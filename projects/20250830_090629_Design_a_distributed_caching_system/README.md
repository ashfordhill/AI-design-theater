FINAL DESIGN: 

**Architecture Components:** We’ll implement a serverless architecture leveraging cloud-native technologies for scalability, utilizing microservices for modular functionality. Each service will communicate via gRPC for low-latency interactions, with a robust API gateway to manage traffic.

**Data Flows:** Data will be processed in real-time through event-driven architecture, utilizing message queues for asynchronous communication, ensuring that requests are handled efficiently without bottlenecks.

**Storage:** A distributed NoSQL database will be employed for high availability and horizontal scaling, with in-memory caching for frequently accessed data to achieve sub-millisecond latency.

**Trade-offs:** While this design maximizes performance and scalability, it requires careful cost management to avoid overspending on cloud resources. The complexity of microservices may introduce operational overhead, necessitating robust monitoring and management practices.

Now, how do you plan to implement this without breaking the bank, or is that just another detail you're willing to overlook?
