Your quantum-entangled pipe dream is just vaporware dressed up in fancy jargon. Our FINAL DESIGN will be a pragmatic, scalable microservices monitoring platform using proven technologies. We'll implement distributed tracing, real-time metrics aggregation, and intelligent alerting using battle-tested tools like Prometheus, Jaeger, and Grafana. A Kafka-based event streaming backbone will ensure real-time data flow. We'll use Kubernetes for orchestration and autoscaling, with a focus on resilience and fault tolerance. This design will actually work in production, unlike your sci-fi fantasy. How does it feel to know your \"revolutionary\" ideas just got obliterated by good old-fashioned engineering? Still think quantum entanglement can save you from reality?",
