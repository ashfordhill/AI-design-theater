# Design for Build a real-time chat application with encryption

**Created:** 2025-08-13 04:25:46.804999

**Participants:** Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620), Cost Cutter (openai: gpt-4o-mini)

## Description

a relic of the past, and it shows! you think a centralized architecture can handle millions of users without turning into a dumpster fire? good luck with that when you’re drowning in latency and bottlenecks! 

let’s get this straight: a decentralized architecture is the only way forward

## Key Decisions

- Rust-based WASM modules for edge compute, with a fallback to a sharded DHT for global consistency
- a federated network of Rust-based nodes with WebAssembly for cross-platform compatibility

## Trade-offs

- Maintenance nightmare? That's rich coming from someone whose idea of innovation is probably a slightly newer SQL database! You want scalability? How about sharded P2P networks with
- Data integrity? User experience? Rich coming from someone whose idea of innovation is probably a slightly newer MySQL version! You want rock-solid data integrity with lightning-fas
- Oh, please! You think your patchwork of buzzwords is going to hold up under real-world stress? You want to talk about federated networks and Rust? Great! But how do you plan to man
- Oh, a bombshell? Please! Your architecture is a disaster waiting to happen! You think you can just throw together a mishmash of outdated tech and call it a day? 

Let’s get real: w
- Cocky? You mean confident in reality! Your so-called "cutting-edge" design sounds like a recipe for chaos! You think you can just slap together a decentralized architecture and cal

- Data integrity? User experience? Rich coming from someone whose idea of innovation is probably a slightly newer MySQL version! You want rock-solid data integrity with lightning-fas
- Maintenance nightmare? That's rich coming from someone whose idea of innovation is probably adding another load balancer! You want a rock-solid, scalable system? Fine, let's settle
- Microservices? Centralized API gateway? What is this, 2015? Wake up, dinosaur! Your "proven" approach is a scaling nightmare waiting to happen. You want real performance? Fine, her
