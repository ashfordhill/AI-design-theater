    "Desperate? That's you clinging to your outdated, penny-pinching playbook! We're building the future here, not a retirement home for legacy systems! Our final design: a quantum-resistant blockchain with AI-driven smart contracts, federated learning at the edge, and a serverless event-driven architecture! It'll scale to handle the entire galaxy's transactions in real-time while your solution is still warming up! What's it like knowing you're the reason we'll lose to the competition? Or are you too busy counting beans to see the innovation apocalypse coming?"
