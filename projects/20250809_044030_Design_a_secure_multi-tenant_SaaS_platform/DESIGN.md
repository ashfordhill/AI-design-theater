## Trade-offs

- powerful, scripting capability? could provide a user-friendly interface for most common security and compliance settings, while also offering an advanced mode that allows for more granular control through a simplified scripting language
- also allow for plug-in modules developed by our team or trusted third-party partners. way, we maintain the simplicity of a visual interface while allowing for extensibility to meet specialized requirements
