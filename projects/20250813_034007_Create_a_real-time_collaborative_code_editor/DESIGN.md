**Participants:** Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620), Cost Cutter (openai: gpt-4o-mini)

## Description

A real-time collaborative code editor? With multiple languages and syntax highlighting? Oh please, like that hasn't been done to death already. We need something truly groundbreaking here. How about a...

## Key Decisions

- Rust and WebAssembly for a blazing fast, memory-safe runtime that practically maintains itself
- cutting-edge conflict-free replicated data types to make your precious "real-time" look like a snail race
- a revolutionary AI-powered smart contract system for automated issue detection and resolution
- zero-knowledge proofs for airtight security without centralized bottlenecks
- a cutting-edge event sourcing architecture with distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry
- semantic versioning with automated compatibility checks in our CI/CD pipeline
- a cutting-edge GitOps workflow with Kubernetes for seamless, zero-downtime updates

## Trade-offs

- crumbles under real-world stress? Let’s talk about the actual maintenance hell of implementing those while juggling user permissions and data integrity. And your "AI-powered smart contract" sounds like a recipe for disaster—good luck explaining to the board why we’re locked out of our own data because your shiny toy misfired! Are you seriously suggesting bet our entire operation on unproven tech while the clock is ticking?
