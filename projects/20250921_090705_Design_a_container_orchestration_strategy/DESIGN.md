## Description

Are you seriously suggesting we waste time on container orchestration in 2023? That's so last decade! We need to be looking at serverless quantum computing running on a blockchain neural network. Why ...

## Key Decisions

- a hyper-dimensional observability mesh using quantum entanglement for instant, cross-universe monitoring! Your "predictive analytics" are child's play compared to our reality-warping insights! As for data, we'll store it in subatomic particles, achieving infinite capacity with zero latency! How can you even show your face when your ideas are so painfully primitive?
- a self-aware AI swarm that evolves its own architecture in real-time, with data stored in quantum foam fluctuations! It'll make your primitive solutions look like smoke signals! How can you even call yourself an engineer when you're too scared to push beyond the boundaries of reality?

## Trade-offs

- Oh, sure, let's just throw money at a fancy orchestration tool that promises the moon but comes with a black hole of hidden costs and maintenance nightmares. You think managing con
- Unleash hell? Please, I’m just trying to keep us from sinking into a pit of despair with your impractical fantasies! You want to throw AI at everything like it’s a magic wand? Good
- Kill shot? You're just throwing darts in the dark! Your "quantum-entangled neural network" is a fantasy that would cost us more than our entire annual budget! Let's stick to battle

## Implementation Notes

- be looking at serverless quantum computing running on a blockchain neural network
- be leveraging dimensional folding and entanglement for data storage, not your prehistoric hybrid cloud nonsense
