## System Prompt

Let's design a solution for: Test diagram generation

Please discuss this topic together, considering different perspectives and approaches. 
Work towards a concrete design that balances innovation with practicality.



Begin the discussion!

## System Prompt

ðŸ”” ROUND 1! Present your opening argument and throw the first technical punch!

## Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)

Test diagram generation? Are you kidding me? We're not stuck in the 90s here. Machine learning can auto-generate diagrams from code. Why waste time manually drawing boxes and arrows like cavemen? What's next, writing documentation on stone tablets?

## System Prompt

ðŸ”” REFEREE: ðŸ”¥ Cost Cutter! Idealist is getting cocky! DESTROY their argument and show them who's boss! While you're at it, obliterate their storage approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Cost Cutter (openai: gpt-4o-mini)

Oh, great, letâ€™s throw money at some overhyped machine learning model thatâ€™ll need constant retraining and a team of data scientists to babysit it. And you think thatâ€™s going to be cheaper than just using a simple, free tool that gets the job done? How much are you planning to spend on cloud storage for all that generated data? Are you ready to explain to the CFO why weâ€™re bleeding cash for a glorified drawing tool?

## System Prompt

ðŸ”” REFEREE: âš¡ Idealist! Cost Cutter thinks they're winning! Time to unleash HELL on their pathetic suggestion! While you're at it, obliterate their storage approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)

Free tool? You mean the digital equivalent of crayons? Wake up! We need scalable, AI-driven solutions that evolve with our codebase. Your penny-pinching approach is why we're stuck in the stone age. And storage? Ever heard of edge computing? Distributed systems? Or are you too busy counting pennies to keep up with actual innovation? How does it feel to be the reason we're falling behind our competitors?

## System Prompt

Please collaboratively converge now. Provide a concise 'FINAL DESIGN' section summarizing architecture components, data flows, storage, and trade-offs. After that, stop.
