    "FINAL DESIGN: A globally distributed, edge-computed chat system using Rust and WebAssembly, with blockchain-based data integrity, eBPF observability, and CRDT conflict resolution. Quantum-resistant encryption throughout, zero-trust architecture, and formal verification for bulletproof reliability. This isn't just a chat app\u2014it's the future of secure, scalable communication. Can your outdated brain even comprehend the innovation here?"
