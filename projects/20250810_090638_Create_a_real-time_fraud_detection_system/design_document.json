    "Given that we've explored various aspects of the system, from core ML models to user interaction, I think we're close to finalizing our design. How do you feel about incorporating this gamified feedback system as a bold, user-centric feature in our final design? Should we start outlining our FINAL DESIGN with the key components we've discussed?"
