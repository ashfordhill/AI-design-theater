## Description

Absolutely! Let's dive into designing a real-time fraud detection system that leverages machine learning for transaction analysis. Here's an initial architectural approach to get us started:

Initial ...

## Key Decisions

- Given that we've explored various aspects of the system, from core ML models to user interaction, I think we're close to finalizing our design. How do you feel about incorporating this gamified feedback system as a bold, user-centric feature in our final design? Should we start outlining our FINAL DESIGN with the key components we've discussed?

## Trade-offs

- Absolutely! Let's dive into designing a real-time fraud detection system that leverages machine learning for transaction analysis. Here's an initial architectural approach to get u
- Great outline! I appreciate the emphasis on a real-time scoring engine and the feedback loop for continuous improvement. 

As we consider security, it's crucial to ensure that our
