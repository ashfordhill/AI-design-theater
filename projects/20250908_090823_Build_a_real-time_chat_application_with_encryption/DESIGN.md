## Description

a ticking time bomb, and when it blows, we’ll be left picking up the pieces while you’re off chasing shiny objects

## Key Decisions

- quantum key distribution and make it unhackable
- MySQL and PHP while we're at it - I'm sure that'll handle millions of users seamlessly

## Trade-offs

- Storage costs? Are you fucking kidding me? We're in 2023, grandpa - ever heard of distributed storage on IPFS? It's decentralized, scalable, and practically free. But I guess that'
- Amateur? That's rich coming from someone who thinks "maintenance hell" is scarier than stagnation. You want scalability? Microservices with Kubernetes, idiot. Costs? Serverless and
- Stable? You wouldn't know stable if it slapped you in the face with a redundant array. Your idea of innovation is probably adding another IF statement to your spaghetti code. Cloud
- Cost-effective? You mean cheap and useless. Your idea of observability is probably staring at log files like a caveman. Wake up! We need distributed tracing, real-time analytics, a
