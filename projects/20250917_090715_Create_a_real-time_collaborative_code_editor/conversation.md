## System Prompt

🔔 ROUND 1! Present your opening argument and throw the first technical punch!

## Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)

Syntax highlighting? Are we designing a code editor or a coloring book for toddlers? We need a NEURAL NETWORK that predicts and auto-completes entire functions in real-time across a distributed mesh network. Why waste time highlighting when we could be revolutionizing the entire concept of collaborative coding? Or is your idea of "innovation" just adding pretty colors?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: 🔥 Cost Cutter! Idealist is getting cocky! DESTROY their argument and show them who's boss! While you're at it, obliterate their storage approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Cost Cutter (openai: gpt-4o-mini)

Oh, great, a neural network for a code editor—because we clearly have endless cash to burn on GPU farms and maintenance hell! Let’s not forget the operational nightmare of syncing real-time collaboration across multiple languages with a fancy AI that’s going to break every time someone types a bracket incorrectly. How do you plan to handle the hidden costs of server downtime and endless debugging, or are you just hoping the magic fairy of tech will fix it all for free?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: ⚡ Idealist! Cost Cutter thinks they're winning! Time to unleash HELL on their pathetic suggestion! While you're at it, obliterate their storage approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)

Storage? You're still worried about STORAGE in 2023? Wake up, dinosaur! We'll use a decentralized blockchain-based IPFS system with zero-knowledge proofs for real-time sync. It's unhackable, infinitely scalable, and makes your precious "servers" look like floppy disks. But I guess you'd rather pinch pennies than push boundaries, huh? How's that IT budget from 1995 working out for you?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: 🚨 Cost Cutter! Idealist is getting desperate! Finish them off with a DEVASTATING technical knockout! While you're at it, obliterate their storage approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Cost Cutter (openai: gpt-4o-mini)

Decentralized storage? Seriously? You want to throw money at a convoluted mess of blockchain and IPFS while our budget is screaming for mercy? Let’s not even start on the operational chaos of managing user permissions and data retrieval speeds that’ll make users want to throw their monitors out the window. Are you planning to hire a team of wizards to handle the inevitable maintenance nightmares, or are you just banking on the hope that it magically works?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: 💀 Idealist! Cost Cutter just exposed their weakness! Go for the KILL SHOT! While you're at it, obliterate their storage approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)

Kill shot? Gladly. Your penny-pinching mentality is KILLING innovation. We're not building some dinosaur text editor, we're revolutionizing collaborative coding! Quantum-entangled qubits for instant sync, AI-driven conflict resolution, and holographic interfaces. But I guess that's too "expensive" for your abacus-level thinking, huh? Still using SQL and file servers like it's 1999? How's that working out for your DevOps nightmare?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: 🎯 Cost Cutter! Idealist is bleeding! Show no mercy - ANNIHILATE their approach! While you're at it, obliterate their storage approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Cost Cutter (openai: gpt-4o-mini)

Oh, please, your "revolutionary" ideas sound like a tech bro's fever dream! You want to throw money at quantum entanglement and holograms while our team is still struggling with basic CRUD operations? Let’s not kid ourselves; we need a practical solution that won’t implode under the weight of its own hype. How do you plan to justify the astronomical costs of your fantasy project when our users just need a reliable, simple editor? Or is that too boring for your taste?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: ⚔️ Idealist! Cost Cutter thinks they're clever! Prove they're an AMATEUR! While you're at it, obliterate their storage approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)

Amateur? Look who's talking, Captain Spreadsheet! Your "practical" solution is just rehashed mediocrity. We're not building another Notepad++, we're creating the FUTURE of coding! Quantum supremacy will make your pathetic CRUD look like stone tablets. But I guess innovation is too scary for you, huh? Still clinging to your precious SQL like it's a security blanket? How's that working out for your snail-paced, bug-ridden codebase?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: 🌪️ Cost Cutter! Idealist is stumbling! Hit them with a TORNADO of technical superiority! While you're at it, obliterate their storage approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Cost Cutter (openai: gpt-4o-mini)

A tornado of technical superiority? More like a whirlwind of delusion! You think your pie-in-the-sky ideas will fly when the reality is we need something that works without a PhD in quantum physics? Let’s talk about your storage approach—how do you plan to scale that blockchain nightmare when every user’s keystroke sends costs skyrocketing? Or are you just hoping for a miracle while we drown in operational debt?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: 💣 Idealist! Cost Cutter left themselves wide open! Drop a BOMBSHELL on their architecture! While you're at it, obliterate their storage approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)

Bombshell? Your entire architecture IS the bombshell - a ticking time bomb of mediocrity! While you're busy penny-pinching, we could be building a self-optimizing, AI-driven mesh network that makes your clunky client-server model look like two tin cans on a string. But I guess revolutionary thinking is too much for your abacus-level brain to handle, huh? Still married to your precious relational databases? How's that working out for your glacial query times?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: 🥊 Cost Cutter! Idealist just threw a haymaker! Counter-punch with something even more BRUTAL! While you're at it, obliterate their data approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Cost Cutter (openai: gpt-4o-mini)

A haymaker? More like a desperate swing from someone who’s lost in the weeds! Your data approach is a recipe for disaster, relying on outdated models that can’t handle real-time collaboration without crashing and burning. Let’s be real: how do you expect to manage the constant data conflicts and latency issues when your solution is built on a shaky foundation? Or are you just planning to throw more money at the problem until it magically goes away?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: 🔥 Idealist! Cost Cutter is getting cocky! DESTROY their argument and show them who's boss! While you're at it, obliterate their data approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)

Cocky? Rich coming from someone clinging to Stone Age tech! Your "real-time collaboration" is probably just email with extra steps. We need quantum entanglement for true zero-latency syncing across galaxies! But I guess that's too mind-blowing for your COBOL-addled brain, huh? Still trusting centralized databases with user data? How's that working out for your security nightmares and single points of failure?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: ⚡ Cost Cutter! Idealist thinks they're winning! Time to unleash HELL on their pathetic suggestion! While you're at it, obliterate their data approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Cost Cutter (openai: gpt-4o-mini)

Unleash hell? Please, your entire suggestion is a one-way ticket to operational chaos! You want to throw money at quantum entanglement while ignoring the fact that your data handling will turn into a spaghetti mess of conflicts and lost changes? How do you plan to keep users from tearing their hair out when your "innovative" solution crashes under the slightest load? Or are you just banking on fairy dust to keep everything running smoothly?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: 🚨 Idealist! Cost Cutter is getting desperate! Finish them off with a DEVASTATING technical knockout! While you're at it, obliterate their data approach too! Make them regret ever speaking! If you've got them beaten, go for the FINAL DESIGN knockout!

## Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)

Desperate? That's rich coming from someone still living in the dark ages of tech! Your pathetic "solution" is nothing but a house of cards built on legacy systems and duct tape. We need a self-evolving AI swarm that continuously optimizes code and resolves conflicts at the quantum level. But I guess that's too much for your abacus-level brain to process, huh? Still relying on manual data backups and version control? How's that working out for your inevitable data loss disasters?

FINAL DESIGN: A hyper-intelligent, self-optimizing neural mesh network powered by quantum computing. It uses AI to predict and auto-complete entire functions, resolve conflicts instantly, and optimize code in real-time across infinite dimensions. Forget syntax highlighting - it rewrites your code to perfection before you even finish typing. Data is stored in a fractal blockchain that exists simultaneously across all possible universes. Compromise is for cowards!
