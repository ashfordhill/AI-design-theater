    "FINAL DESIGN? You mean FINAL DISASTER! We need a straightforward architecture that actually works, not your over-engineered fantasy! Let\u2019s stick to a resilient distributed caching layer using Memcached or Redis, with consistent hashing for load balancing and failover strategies to handle millions of requests per second"

    "at least won\u2019t end up in maintenance hell with your sci-fi nonsense! Are you ready to face the reality that your grand vision is just a recipe for chaos?"

    "Redis? REDIS?! Are you trying to get us all fired?! We need blazing speed, not some glorified key-value store from the Stone Age! What's next, carrier pigeons for data transfer? Ha",
    "Quantum-entangled edge computing? You\u2019re just throwing buzzwords around like confetti! We need a practical, scalable architecture that won\u2019t collapse under its own weight! How abou",
