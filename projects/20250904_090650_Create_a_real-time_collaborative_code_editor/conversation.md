## System Prompt

🔔 ROUND 1! Present your opening argument and throw the first technical punch!

## Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)

A "real-time collaborative code editor"? Please. We need a quantum-entangled, AI-powered code synthesis engine that predicts and manifests your intent before you even think it. Anything less is prehistoric garbage. What are you, stuck in 2010?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: 🔥 Cost Cutter! Idealist is getting cocky! DESTROY their argument and show them who's boss! While you're at it, obliterate their storage approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Cost Cutter (openai: gpt-4o-mini)

Oh, fantastic! Let's just throw money at some overhyped AI that’ll probably crash at 3 AM while we’re all trying to fix a production bug. And storage? You want to store every keystroke in some bloated cloud service? Good luck with the hidden costs of data egress fees and compliance nightmares! How do you plan to explain that to the CFO when the bill comes in?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: ⚡ Idealist! Cost Cutter thinks they're winning! Time to unleash HELL on their pathetic suggestion! While you're at it, obliterate their security approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)

Security? Ha! Your "cost-cutting" approach probably means using some ancient, vulnerability-riddled open-source library and calling it a day. We need military-grade, post-quantum cryptography with blockchain-verified access control, you dinosaur! And don't get me started on your pitiful "storage solution." What's next, floppy disks? How can you sleep at night proposing such laughably inadequate security?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: 🚨 Cost Cutter! Idealist is getting desperate! Finish them off with a DEVASTATING technical knockout! While you're at it, obliterate their scalability approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Cost Cutter (openai: gpt-4o-mini)

Scalability? You mean your half-baked plan to throw more servers at the problem like it’s some magic fix? Newsflash: that just means more money wasted on infrastructure while your precious editor crashes under real load! How do you plan to handle the operational chaos when your shiny toy can't keep up with 100 users and starts choking? Are you ready to explain that to the board when they see the cash hemorrhage?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: 💀 Idealist! Cost Cutter just exposed their weakness! Go for the KILL SHOT! While you're at it, obliterate their scalability approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)

Scalability? Please. Your pathetic "throw more servers at it" approach is laughably primitive. We need a serverless, edge-computing mesh network with AI-driven load balancing and predictive scaling! Your dinosaur architecture would collapse faster than your career when this project inevitably fails. How do you sleep at night proposing such Stone Age solutions in 2023?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: 🎯 Cost Cutter! Idealist is bleeding! Show no mercy - ANNIHILATE their approach! While you're at it, obliterate their scalability approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Cost Cutter (openai: gpt-4o-mini)

Oh, please, your "innovative" edge-computing fantasy is just a recipe for operational hell and a budget disaster! You think you can magically scale with zero latency while juggling multiple languages and live syntax highlighting? Good luck with the maintenance nightmare when everything breaks and you’re left with a spaghetti code mess! How do you plan to justify that dumpster fire to the investors when they see the chaos unfold?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: ⚔️ Idealist! Cost Cutter thinks they're clever! Prove they're an AMATEUR! While you're at it, obliterate their observability approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)

Observability? Let me guess, you'll slap on some off-the-shelf logging solution and call it a day? We need real-time, AI-powered anomaly detection with quantum-encrypted telemetry streams! Your stone-age approach would leave us flying blind in production. How do you sleep knowing you're setting us up for catastrophic failure when shit inevitably hits the fan?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: 🌪️ Cost Cutter! Idealist is stumbling! Hit them with a TORNADO of technical superiority! While you're at it, obliterate their api approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Cost Cutter (openai: gpt-4o-mini)

API approach? Oh, you mean your glorified REST endpoints that’ll be slower than molasses and as secure as a paper bag in a rainstorm? We need microservices with gRPC and zero-trust architecture, not your outdated, clunky mess! How do you expect to handle the traffic when your API is a bottleneck, and your precious users are left waiting? Are you ready to face the wrath of the users when they realize your "solution" is a total joke?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: 💣 Idealist! Cost Cutter left themselves wide open! Drop a BOMBSHELL on their architecture! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)

Architecture? You call that spaghetti mess of microservices an architecture? We need a cutting-edge, event-driven system with CQRS and event sourcing, running on a Rust-based WebAssembly runtime! Your bloated, overengineered disaster is the digital equivalent of a house of cards. How can you even show your face proposing such an amateur-hour setup? Are you trying to sabotage this project?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: 🥊 Cost Cutter! Idealist just threw a haymaker! Counter-punch with something even more BRUTAL! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Cost Cutter (openai: gpt-4o-mini)

Oh, please! Your "cutting-edge" architecture sounds like a tech bro's fever dream! We need battle-tested, proven designs that won't implode under pressure, not your shiny new toys that will cost us a fortune in downtime and debugging! How do you plan to keep the lights on when your grand vision turns into a maintenance nightmare, and the team is drowning in tech debt?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: 🔥 Idealist! Cost Cutter is getting cocky! DESTROY their argument and show them who's boss! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)

Battle-tested? You mean outdated and obsolete! Your "proven" designs are just glorified legacy systems waiting to collapse! We need bleeding-edge tech to stay competitive, not your fossil of an architecture. How do you expect to attract top talent when your tech stack is older than the interns? Are you actively trying to drive this company into the ground with your pathetic, risk-averse mindset?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: ⚡ Cost Cutter! Idealist thinks they're winning! Time to unleash HELL on their pathetic suggestion! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Cost Cutter (openai: gpt-4o-mini)

Oh, spare me the theatrics! Your "bleeding-edge tech" is just a shiny distraction from the reality of operational chaos and spiraling costs. We need solutions that are robust and maintainable, not your flashy, overhyped nonsense that will have us drowning in complexity! How do you plan to explain to the board why we’re burning cash on your latest tech fad when we could be delivering real value?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: 🚨 Idealist! Cost Cutter is getting desperate! Finish them off with a DEVASTATING technical knockout! Make them regret ever speaking! If you've got them beaten, go for the FINAL DESIGN knockout!

## Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)

Robust and maintainable? You mean BORING and STAGNANT! Wake up, dinosaur! We're building a real-time collaborative editor, not some crusty COBOL mainframe! Here's the knockout design: Rust-based WebAssembly core for blazing performance, serverless edge computing for instant global scalability, and AI-driven conflict resolution. Multi-language support? Quantum language model that adapts in real-time. Security? Post-quantum encryption with blockchain-verified access. It's the future, grandpa - try to keep up! How does it feel to be professionally obsolete?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: 💀 Cost Cutter! Idealist just exposed their weakness! Go for the KILL SHOT! Make them regret ever speaking! If you've got them beaten, go for the FINAL DESIGN knockout!

## Cost Cutter (openai: gpt-4o-mini)

Oh, please! Your "future-proof" design sounds like a tech utopia that’ll collapse under its own weight! You think you can just sprinkle some AI pixie dust and call it a day? We need a practical, battle-tested approach that won’t turn into a maintenance nightmare! How do you expect to keep that monstrosity running when the team is buried under complexity and your shiny features are nothing but a mirage? Are you ready to face the reality of your grand delusions?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: 🎯 Idealist! Cost Cutter is bleeding! Show no mercy - ANNIHILATE their approach! Make them regret ever speaking! If you've got them beaten, go for the FINAL DESIGN knockout!

## Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)

Battle-tested? More like battle-weary and obsolete! Fine, you want a knockout? Here's the FINAL DESIGN: WebAssembly core compiled from Rust, running on a serverless edge network. Language agnostic AST for multi-language support, with AI-powered syntax highlighting. Zero-trust security model with homomorphic encryption for collaborative editing. Blockchain for immutable version control. How's that for practical AND cutting-edge? Still clinging to your Stone Age solutions?
