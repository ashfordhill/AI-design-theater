    "As a bolder option, aligning with our principle to favor user-delighting capabilities even if the architecture is novel, what if we implemented a \"smart\" GraphQL layer that dynamically generates optimal queries based on usage patterns? This could involve using machine learning to predict and pre-fetch commonly requested data, resulting in lightning-fast response times and an incredibly smooth developer experience"
