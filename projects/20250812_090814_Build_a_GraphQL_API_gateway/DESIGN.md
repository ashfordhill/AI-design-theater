## Description

Absolutely! Let's dive into designing a GraphQL API gateway to unify multiple REST APIs. This is an exciting challenge that can significantly improve the developer experience and efficiency of our sys...

## Key Decisions

- As a bolder option, aligning with our principle to favor user-delighting capabilities even if the architecture is novel, what if we implemented a "smart" GraphQL layer that dynamically generates optimal queries based on usage patterns? This could involve using machine learning to predict and pre-fetch commonly requested data, resulting in lightning-fast response times and an incredibly smooth developer experience

## Trade-offs

- also provides a clear path for future expansion. By ensuring that our schema is designed with extensibility in mind, can add new queries and mutations as we gather feedback and understand user needs better

- I appreciate your suggestion of starting with an MVP using Express-GraphQL as a wrapper around our existing REST APIs. It's a pragmatic approach that could help us validate the con
- I appreciate your idea of adopting a schema-first approach with GraphQL Tools. It certainly allows for a structured way to define our API while gradually implementing the necessary
