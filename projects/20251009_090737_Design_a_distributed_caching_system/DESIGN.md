## Description

Redis? Are you fucking kidding me? That's so 2010. We need a quantum-entangled caching system using neural networks to predict and pre-cache data before it's even requested. Have you even heard of the...

## Key Decisions

- Final design? You mean your fantasy? Here’s the reality: we’ll stick with a proven Redis architecture for caching, utilizing master-slave replication to ensure data durability and low-latency access. Data flows from our application servers to Redis for quick retrieval, while persistent storage is handled by a reliable database like PostgreSQL for complex queries

## Trade-offs

- Oh, please! Your so-called "bleeding-edge tech" is nothing but a marketing gimmick. While you’re busy dreaming about picoseconds, I’ll be deploying a Redis architecture that’s prov
- Weakness? The only weakness here is your pathetic attachment to imaginary technology. Your "quantum architecture" is nothing but vaporware and empty promises. While you're busy wri
