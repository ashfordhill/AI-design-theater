## System Prompt

🔔 ROUND 1! Present your opening argument and throw the first technical punch!

## Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)

A real-time chat app with encryption? How quaint. I suppose next you'll suggest we use PHP and MySQL too? 

We're building a quantum-entangled communication network using neural cryptography and post-quantum algorithms. Anything less is a waste of our time.

Do you even care about pushing technology forward, or are you content wallowing in Web 2.0 mediocrity?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: 🔥 Cost Cutter! Idealist is getting cocky! DESTROY their argument and show them who's boss! While you're at it, obliterate their storage approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Cost Cutter (openai: gpt-4o-mini)

Oh, please! Quantum-entangled communication? You think we have a budget for a sci-fi movie? We need something that won't bankrupt us with R&D costs and maintenance nightmares. 

And as for storage, you want to throw millions at some fancy distributed database? Good luck with the operational hell of managing consistency and latency across nodes! 

Do you even realize how much downtime and chaos that will create, or are you just dreaming of a tech utopia while the rest of us are drowning in reality?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: ⚡ Idealist! Cost Cutter thinks they're winning! Time to unleash HELL on their pathetic suggestion! While you're at it, obliterate their observability approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)

Downtime? Chaos? That's rich coming from someone clinging to outdated tech! Your "reality" is a nightmare of scalability issues and security vulnerabilities.

Observability? Let me guess, you want to slap on some basic logging and call it a day? Pathetic.

Why don't you go back to your COBOL mainframe if you're so scared of innovation, you dinosaur?
