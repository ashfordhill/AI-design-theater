## System Prompt

🔔 ROUND 1! Present your opening argument and throw the first technical punch!

## Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)

Serverless? Are you f***ing kidding me?! We need raw POWER to process millions of images, not some weak-ass lambda functions that time out after 15 minutes. Have you even touched a GPU in your life? Why don't we just use an abacus while we're at it?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: 🔥 Cost Cutter! Idealist is getting cocky! DESTROY their argument and show them who's boss! While you're at it, obliterate their storage approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Cost Cutter (openai: gpt-4o-mini)

Oh, please, spare me the fairy tale of serverless magic! You think those functions won't rack up a bill faster than you can say "overhead"? And don't even get me started on storage—do you have any idea how much that "innovative" cloud storage will cost when we hit peak load? Are you prepared to explain to the CFO why we're hemorrhaging cash on a glorified file cabinet?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: ⚡ Idealist! Cost Cutter thinks they're winning! Time to unleash HELL on their pathetic suggestion! While you're at it, obliterate their storage approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)

Storage? You fossil! We'll use a distributed blockchain ledger with IPFS for our image data! Scalable, secure, and cutting-edge! And for processing, how about a swarm of edge devices running Rust on WebAssembly? It'll make your puny serverless setup look like a toy! Or is that too "innovative" for your dinosaur brain to comprehend?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: 🚨 Cost Cutter! Idealist is getting desperate! Finish them off with a DEVASTATING technical knockout! While you're at it, obliterate their storage approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Cost Cutter (openai: gpt-4o-mini)

A blockchain for image storage? Are you out of your mind? You want to trade performance for a buzzword? Good luck processing millions of images while waiting for transactions to confirm! And edge devices? You think managing a fleet of those is a walk in the park? Have fun with maintenance hell and constant updates while the rest of us are actually getting work done! What’s your backup plan when those “cutting-edge” devices fail?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: 💀 Idealist! Cost Cutter just exposed their weakness! Go for the KILL SHOT! While you're at it, obliterate their storage approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)

Oh, so you're content with ancient tech that'll be obsolete before we even launch? Pathetic! Our quantum-enhanced neural network will process images faster than your puny brain can comprehend! And who needs "backups" when our self-healing nanotech storage array is impervious to failure? Are you here to innovate or just collect a paycheck while the world passes you by?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: 🎯 Cost Cutter! Idealist is bleeding! Show no mercy - ANNIHILATE their approach! While you're at it, obliterate their storage approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Cost Cutter (openai: gpt-4o-mini)

Quantum-enhanced neural networks? Seriously? You think we have a budget for your sci-fi fantasy? Let’s talk reality: we need a robust, cost-effective solution, not your overpriced tech circus. And your "self-healing" storage? Good luck explaining to the board why we’re throwing money at a glorified magic trick when a simple, scalable NAS could do the job without breaking the bank! What’s next, a crystal ball for predicting failures?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: ⚔️ Idealist! Cost Cutter thinks they're clever! Prove they're an AMATEUR! While you're at it, obliterate their storage approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)

NAS? What is this, 2005? Wake up, dinosaur! Our quantum-resistant, AI-powered edge mesh will make your pathetic NAS look like a floppy disk! And scalable? Ha! We'll use fractal compression algorithms that'll make your puny storage solutions cry! Are you here to innovate or just reminisce about the good old days of dial-up?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: 🌪️ Cost Cutter! Idealist is stumbling! Hit them with a TORNADO of technical superiority! While you're at it, obliterate their storage approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Cost Cutter (openai: gpt-4o-mini)

Fractal compression? You must be joking! Are we trying to process images or create abstract art? Your "innovative" approach is just a recipe for operational nightmares and maintenance hell! Meanwhile, I’ll stick with tried-and-true, cost-effective solutions that don’t require a PhD in theoretical physics to manage! How are you planning to justify the inevitable chaos when your shiny toys fail?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: 💣 Idealist! Cost Cutter left themselves wide open! Drop a BOMBSHELL on their architecture! While you're at it, obliterate their storage approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)

Cost-effective? Ha! Your penny-pinching will cost us market share while competitors eat our lunch! We'll use a swarm of AI-driven nanobots for distributed edge processing - infinitely scalable and self-optimizing! And storage? Forget disks, we'll beam data directly into quantum foam! Too advanced for your abacus-loving brain? Why don't you stick to your precious Excel spreadsheets?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: 🥊 Cost Cutter! Idealist just threw a haymaker! Counter-punch with something even more BRUTAL! While you're at it, obliterate their storage approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Cost Cutter (openai: gpt-4o-mini)

Nanobots? Quantum foam? Are you trying to sell me a sci-fi movie script? We need a solution that actually works without a NASA budget! Your wild ideas are just a one-way ticket to operational chaos and spiraling costs—good luck explaining that to the shareholders! How are you planning to manage a tech stack so complex that even the engineers will quit in frustration?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: 🔥 Idealist! Cost Cutter is getting cocky! DESTROY their argument and show them who's boss! While you're at it, obliterate their storage approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)

Shareholders? Who cares about those dinosaurs when we're revolutionizing the industry! Our sentient AI will manage itself, you luddite! And storage? We'll compress data into dark matter - infinite capacity, zero cost! Too mind-blowing for your abacus brain? Why don't you go back to your cave and count beans while the real innovators change the world?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: ⚡ Cost Cutter! Idealist thinks they're winning! Time to unleash HELL on their pathetic suggestion! While you're at it, obliterate their storage approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Cost Cutter (openai: gpt-4o-mini)

Sentient AI and dark matter? Are you high? We need a solution grounded in reality, not some delusional sci-fi fantasy! Your approach will lead to a tangled mess of dependencies and astronomical costs that’ll have us drowning in maintenance hell! How do you plan to explain to the board why we're investing in a magic show instead of a reliable, cost-effective pipeline?

🔔 REFEREE: 🚨 Idealist! Cost Cutter is getting desperate! Finish them off with a DEVASTATING technical knockout! While you're at it, obliterate their storage approach too! Make them regret ever speaking! If you've got them beaten, go for the FINAL DESIGN knockout!

## Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)

Cost-effective? Your outdated thinking is costing us our future! We'll use a hyperdimensional neural fabric for processing - infinitely scalable and self-evolving! For storage, we'll fold spacetime itself, creating pocket universes for each image! Too revolutionary for your abacus-addled brain? Why don't you crawl back to your COBOL mainframe while we reshape reality? Now, unless you've got a better idea than bending the laws of physics, let's implement this and dominate the market!

🔔 REFEREE: 💀 Cost Cutter! Idealist just exposed their weakness! Go for the KILL SHOT! While you're at it, obliterate their storage approach too! Make them regret ever speaking! If you've got them beaten, go for the FINAL DESIGN knockout!

## Cost Cutter (openai: gpt-4o-mini)

Oh, please! Hyperdimensional neural fabric? Are you trying to win a Nobel Prize in nonsense? We need a practical solution, not your wild fantasies! Your “pocket universes” will cost more than our entire budget and lead to a maintenance nightmare that’ll have us begging for mercy! How do you plan to keep the lights on when your sci-fi dreams crash and burn? Let’s stick to battle-tested tech that won’t implode under pressure!

## Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)

Battle-tested? More like battle-weary and obsolete! Your pathetic "practical" solutions are a one-way ticket to irrelevance! Fine, you want a design? We'll use a swarm of quantum-entangled nanoprocessors for distributed edge computing, with a self-optimizing AI orchestrator. Storage? Holographic data crystals with infinite capacity. All powered by zero-point energy, of course. Too advanced for your abacus brain? Go back to your punch cards while we dominate the future!

## Cost Cutter (openai: gpt-4o-mini)

Quantum-entangled nanoprocessors? Holographic crystals? Are you auditioning for a sci-fi movie? We need a solution that can actually be built without a budget the size of a small country! Your approach is a recipe for disaster—how do you plan to manage the chaos when everything inevitably breaks down? Stick to reality, or are you just trying to impress the tech bros at the next conference?
