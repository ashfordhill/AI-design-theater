It'll make your puny serverless setup look like a toy! Or is that too \"innovative\" for your dinosaur brain to comprehend?",

Too revolutionary for your abacus-addled brain? Why don't you crawl back to your COBOL mainframe while we reshape reality? Now, unless you've got a better idea than bending the laws of physics, let's implement this and dominate the market!",
