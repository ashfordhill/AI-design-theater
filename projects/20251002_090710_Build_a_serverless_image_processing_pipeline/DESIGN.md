# Design for Build a serverless image processing pipeline

**Created:** 2025-10-02 09:08:08.665503

**Participants:** Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620), Cost Cutter (openai: gpt-4o-mini)

## Description

a recipe for disaster—how do you plan to manage the chaos when everything inevitably breaks down? stick to reality, or are you just trying to impress the tech bros at the next conference?

## Key Decisions

- a distributed blockchain ledger with IPFS for our image data! Scalable, secure, and cutting-edge! And for processing, how about a swarm of edge devices running Rust on WebAssembly? It'll make your puny serverless setup look like a toy! Or is that too "innovative" for your dinosaur brain to comprehend?
- fractal compression algorithms that'll make your puny storage solutions cry! Are you here to innovate or just reminisce about the good old days of dial-up?
- a swarm of AI-driven nanobots for distributed edge processing - infinitely scalable and self-optimizing! And storage? Forget disks, we'll beam data directly into quantum foam! Too advanced for your abacus-loving brain? Why don't you stick to your precious Excel spreadsheets?
- a hyperdimensional neural fabric for processing - infinitely scalable and self-evolving! For storage, we'll fold spacetime itself, creating pocket universes for each image! Too revolutionary for your abacus-addled brain? Why don't you crawl back to your COBOL mainframe while we reshape reality? Now, unless you've got a better idea than bending the laws of physics, let's implement this and dominate the market!
- a swarm of quantum-entangled nanoprocessors for distributed edge computing, with a self-optimizing AI orchestrator

## Implementation Notes

- Quantum-enhanced neural networks? Seriously? You think we have a budget for your sci-fi fantasy? Let’s talk reality: we need a robust, cost-effective solution, not your overpriced 
- Quantum-entangled nanoprocessors? Holographic crystals? Are you auditioning for a sci-fi movie? We need a solution that can actually be built without a budget the size of a small c
