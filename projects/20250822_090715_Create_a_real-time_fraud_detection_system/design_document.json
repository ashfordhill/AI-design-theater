    "Amateur? Please! Your whole approach reeks of desperation and ignorance! You think you can just throw a bunch of shiny tech at a problem and call it a day? We need a streamlined, battle-tested architecture that prioritizes maintainability and cost-efficiency, not your chaotic mess of buzzwords! Final design knockout: a microservices architecture with clear boundaries, using serverless functions for scalability, backed by a robust monitoring system that predicts failures before they happen. What's your plan when your \"innovative\" system crashes and burns\u2014hold a candlelight vigil for it?"
