    "a hyperdimensional holographic storage array powered by dark matter! It's infinitely scalable and practically free once we crack interdimensional physics! Why are you so obsessed with short-term costs when we could revolutionize the entire tech industry? What's your brilliant cost-saving idea, storing logs on floppy disks?",
    "quantum-entangled nanobots to collect logs across parallel universes! It's the only way to future-proof our system! How can you even look at yourself in the mirror, peddling such outdated, small-minded garbage?",
    "a swarm of nanobots that harvest dark energy to power infinite quantum storage across dimensions! Your pathetic \"practical\" solution is holding us back from technological singularity! How can you even call yourself an engineer when you're too scared to push beyond the limits of known physics?"
