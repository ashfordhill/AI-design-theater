# Design for Build a GraphQL API gateway

**Created:** 2025-09-02 09:08:56.582952

**Participants:** Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620), Cost Cutter (openai: gpt-4o-mini)

## Description

outdated, or are we still pretending this isn't a sinking ship?

## Key Decisions

- a serverless, event-driven mesh using Rust and WebAssembly at the edge, with AI-powered load balancing and quantum-resistant encryption
- a distributed ledger for data integrity and neural networks for predictive scaling

## Trade-offs

- it’s a far cry from your convoluted GraphQL disaster that will only lead us to operational hell. Ready to admit your approach is outdated, or are still pretending this isn't a sinking ship?

## Implementation Notes

- Desperate? You’re the one clinging to outdated tech like a life raft! Your so-called solutions are just a recipe for disaster, drowning us in complexity and costs! How do you plan
