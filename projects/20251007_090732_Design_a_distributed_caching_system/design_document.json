    "Amateur? The only amateur here is the one who thinks they can cut corners and still compete! Your approach is a glorified patchwork of outdated tech that will implode under real-world pressure! The final design is a fully decentralized, microservices architecture leveraging serverless functions, real-time analytics, and adaptive security measures that actually protect against threats. Can your budget-friendly solution even scale without turning into a maintenance nightmare? Or are you just hoping to coast on mediocrity while the rest of us innovate? How does it feel to be the reason we can't move forward?"
