## Description

A real-time collaborative editor? With syntax highlighting? Oh please, like that hasn't been done to death already. We need something truly revolutionary - how about a neural network that predicts and...

## Trade-offs

- I guess you're too busy counting pennies to see the big picture? How does it feel knowing you'll be replaced by an AI before project even launches?
- I guess you'd rather play it safe than lead the pack? How about for a final design: Rust-based backend, WebAssembly frontend, quantum-encrypted P2P storage, and AI-driven everything
