## Key Decisions

- homomorphic encryption to process sensitive info without ever decrypting it
- quantum-resistant cryptography to future-proof our data protection while you're still patching decade-old vulnerabilities
- AI-driven data sharding and quantum-resistant encryption to guarantee isolation
- post-quantum cryptography and homomorphic encryption to ensure data isolation that's lightyears beyond your pathetic attempts
- homomorphic encryption for data processing and zero-knowledge proofs for access control

## Trade-offs

- Automatic compliance? That’s adorable! But how exactly are you going to manage the sheer complexity of your "quantum-encrypted" mess without drowning in costs and operational heada

## Implementation Notes

- Tried-and-true? You mean tired and obsolete! Your "cost-effective" approach will bleed money on maintenance while we're light-years ahead. We'll use AI-driven data sharding and qua
- Winning? Not even close! Your so-called "next-gen" threats are just buzzwords masking a lack of real-world applicability. While you’re busy chasing shiny objects, I’ll be implement
