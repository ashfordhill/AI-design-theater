## System Prompt

🔔 ROUND 1! Present your opening argument and throw the first technical punch!

## Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)

Collaborative code editor? Pfft, welcome to 2010! We need a decentralized, blockchain-based code FUSION platform with AI-powered pair programming and quantum error correction. Why waste time with syntax highlighting when we could have holographic code visualization? Are you trying to bore developers to death?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: 🔥 Cost Cutter! Idealist is getting cocky! DESTROY their argument and show them who's boss! While you're at it, obliterate their storage approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Cost Cutter (openai: gpt-4o-mini)

Oh, fantastic! Let’s throw money at a blockchain solution that’ll take a decade to implement and cost us a fortune in server fees. You want holograms? Great, let’s just burn cash on hardware that’ll be obsolete before it even arrives! How do you plan to maintain that circus while keeping the lights on? Or are we just going to hope it runs on fairy dust and good intentions?

## System Prompt

FINAL DESIGN: 

**Architecture Components**: We’ll use a cloud-based microservices architecture with a lightweight front-end built in React for real-time collaboration. The back-end will handle multiple programming languages, leveraging a robust API for syntax highlighting and real-time updates.

**Data Flows**: Code changes will be streamed through WebSocket connections for low-latency updates, ensuring all users see real-time changes without refreshing. User actions will be logged for auditing and debugging purposes.

**Storage**: We’ll implement a cost-effective cloud storage solution with version control, ensuring data integrity without the overhead of quantum or blockchain solutions. 

**Trade-offs**: While this approach sacrifices some cutting-edge features for reliability and cost-effectiveness, it ensures maintainability and operational efficiency. Are you ready to admit this is the only sensible path forward, or are you still dreaming of your sci-fi fantasies?
