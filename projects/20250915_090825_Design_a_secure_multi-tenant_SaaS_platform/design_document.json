  "description": "so simplistic it\u2019s laughable\u2014what are you going to do when a single tenant\u2019s data breach takes down the entire system? we need a microservices architecture with strict api gateways to ensure isolation, not your clunky monolith! and as for storage, how about using object storage with lifecycle management instead of your bloated, overpriced solution? do you even understand the concept of scalability, or are you just hoping for the best?",
