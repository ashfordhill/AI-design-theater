    "Operational costs? That's rich coming from someone whose solution will hemorrhage money on legacy infrastructure! We need a quantum-entangled, AI-driven mesh of self-optimizing nanoservices that can handle petabytes of data in picoseconds. Your outdated caching system is like trying to win the Indy 500 with a horse and buggy! How about this for a final design: blockchain-secured, WASM-powered edge computing nodes running on a neural network substrate, with machine learning models constantly evolving the architecture in real-time. Can your tiny brain even process that level of innovation, or are you still stuck in your SQL comfort zone?"

    "that without drowning in costs and complexity? Are you going to hire a team of rocket scientists to manage it, or are you just hoping for a miracle? Because let me tell you, when that system crashes, it won\u2019t be the AI you\u2019re relying on; it\u2019ll be the same old manual troubleshooting that\u2019s cost us millions before! Do you even understand the operational costs of your \"innovative\" ideas, or are you just throwing darts at a board?",
