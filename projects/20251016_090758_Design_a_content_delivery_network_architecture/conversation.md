🔔 ROUND 1! Present your opening argument and throw the first technical punch!

## Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)

A content delivery network? Are you fucking kidding me? That's so 2005 I can smell the MySpace on it. We need a decentralized mesh network powered by quantum entanglement and run on Rust. How about you join us in this century, grandpa?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: 🔥 Cost Cutter! Idealist is getting cocky! DESTROY their argument and show them who's boss! While you're at it, obliterate their storage approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Cost Cutter (openai: gpt-4o-mini)

Oh, please! Quantum entanglement? Sure, let’s just throw our budget into a black hole while we’re at it! You think fancy tech is going to magically solve our uptime issues? Newsflash: it’s the operational costs and maintenance nightmares that’ll bury us. What’s your plan for handling the inevitable outages when your “cutting-edge” solution implodes? Or are we just going to pray to the tech gods?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: ⚡ Idealist! Cost Cutter thinks they're winning! Time to unleash HELL on their pathetic suggestion! While you're at it, obliterate their storage approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)

Oh, so we're just gonna roll over and play dead with some boring old CDN? Pathetic. While you're penny-pinching, the competition will lap us with bleeding-edge tech. You want storage? How about decentralized IPFS with AI-optimized caching? Or are you too scared to touch anything invented after the abacus?

## System Prompt

## Cost Cutter (openai: gpt-4o-mini)

Decentralized IPFS? Great, let's just invite chaos into our lives! You think managing that mess will be easy? Good luck with the hidden costs of data retrieval and the maintenance hell of keeping it all running smoothly. How do you plan to explain to the board why our uptime is tanking because your “innovative” storage solution is a glorified dumpster fire? Or is that just part of the grand plan to watch the company burn?

## System Prompt

🔔 REFEREE: 💀 Idealist! Cost Cutter just exposed their weakness! Go for the KILL SHOT! While you're at it, obliterate their storage approach too! Make them regret ever speaking!

## Idealist (anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)

Hidden costs? You mean like the opportunity cost of being left in the dust by competitors? At least our "dumpster fire" is pushing boundaries. What's your brilliant storage plan - more overpriced AWS instances? How does it feel to be so creatively bankrupt you can't even imagine life beyond legacy tech?

## System Prompt
