> Collaborative code editor? Yawn. How about a QUANTUM ENTANGLED CODE MANIFESTER?! We'll use qubits to instantly sync changes across the multiverse. Syntax highlighting? Try NEURAL SYNAPTIC HIGHLIGHTING that predicts and autocompletes entire systems! What are you, stuck in 2010?

> Oh great, let’s just throw money at a "QUANTUM" solution that’ll cost us a fortune in R&D and probably require a PhD in theoretical physics to maintain. And neural synaptic highlighting? You mean a complex mess that’ll need constant tuning and likely crash every time someone types too fast? How do you plan to explain to the finance team why we just burned through a million bucks on a glorified science experiment? What’s your backup plan when it inevitably fails?

And your storage solution sounds like it’ll be a maintenance nightmare, with costs skyrocketing as we scramble to fix the inevitable data corruption! How do you plan to handle the chaos when your "vision" crashes and burns, leaving us with a pile of unusable code and angry developers? What’s your exit strategy when the whole thing implodes?

You think immutable records are going to save us when we’re drowning in operational overhead and complexity? What’s your plan when the entire system collapses under its own weight and we’re left explaining to the board why we just flushed millions down the toilet? Are you even listening to yourself, or just high on your own hype?

Good luck explaining that to the finance team when they see a budget that looks like a black hole! What’s your plan when we can’t even find qualified engineers to touch that mess? Are you ready to face the reality that your “superior” ideas are just a ticket to a maintenance nightmare?

Good luck explaining that to the team when they’re knee-deep in a maintenance hellscape! And your storage approach? You think we can afford to throw our cash into a black box that nobody understands?

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
