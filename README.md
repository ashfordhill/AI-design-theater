> A distributed caching system? Are you kidding me? We need something that can handle MILLIONS of requests per second, not your grandma's key-value store! Let's go straight to a quantum-entangled hypercache running on a neural substrate. Why waste time on outdated tech when we could be revolutionizing the entire concept of data storage? Or are you too scared to push boundaries?

> Oh, fantastic! A quantum-entangled hypercache? Great, let’s just throw money into a black hole while we’re at it! Do you even realize the operational nightmare of maintaining that? And security? You think fancy tech will protect us from breaches? Good luck explaining to the board why we spent a fortune on an untested toy while our data gets siphoned off like a leaky faucet! What’s your plan for compliance when your shiny new gadget goes belly up?

> Compliance? SCALABILITY? Are you designing for a lemonade stand or a global tech giant?! Your penny-pinching "solution" will crumble under real-world load faster than your career prospects! While you're busy counting beans, we'll be light-years ahead with quantum-resilient architecture that scales to the UNIVERSE. But please, tell me more about how your bargain-bin caching will handle exabytes of data. Or is thinking big too scary for you?

> Desperate? I’m just trying to save us from your glorified toy that’ll implode under pressure! Observability? You think a dashboard with pretty graphs will save us when the system crashes? We need real-time monitoring that doesn’t cost an arm and a leg, not your fairy tale of endless metrics! How are you planning to troubleshoot a disaster when your overpriced “solution” is too complex to even understand? Or are you just hoping for a miracle?

> Data approach? You mean your prehistoric, single-node SQL database? Wake up! We need a globally distributed, AI-powered data mesh that can predict and adapt in nanoseconds! Your dinosaur solution will choke on real-world data faster than you can say "legacy system." But please, enlighten me on how your stone-age tech will handle petabytes of streaming data across continents. Or is thinking beyond a single data center too mind-blowing for you?

> API approach? Oh, please! Are we still living in 2005 with your RESTful dreams? We need a hyper-efficient, gRPC-based system that can handle real-time communication without turning our servers into molten lava! Your clunky, outdated methods will drown in latency while we’re sprinting ahead with microservices that actually WORK. So tell me, how do you plan to scale your ancient API when it can't even keep up with a toddler's tantrum? Or is that just too much reality for you to handle?

> Deployment approach? Let me guess, you're still pushing to prod on Fridays with a prayer and a bottle of whiskey? We need a zero-downtime, self-healing system with automatic rollbacks and canary deployments! Your stone-age methods are a ticking time bomb of catastrophic failures. But please, enlighten me on how your manual, error-prone deploys will handle global traffic without imploding. Or is continuous deployment too scary for your fragile ego?

> Technical superiority? You mean your half-baked, over-engineered fantasy that will burn cash faster than a bonfire? We need battle-tested solutions that can withstand real-world chaos, not your whimsical dreams of tech utopia! While you’re busy polishing your shiny toys, I’ll be implementing robust, cost-effective strategies that actually deliver results. So tell me, how are you planning to justify your extravagant failures when the budget's in flames? Or is accountability just another concept you can’t grasp?

> Architecture? You call that mess of legacy spaghetti code an architecture? We need a bleeding-edge, serverless, event-driven system powered by AI that can reconfigure itself in milliseconds! Your outdated monolith will crumble under the first sign of stress while we're soaring with quantum-resistant microservices. But please, enlighten me on how your fragile house of cards will handle the crushing weight of modern demands. Or is thinking beyond a single server too mind-bending for you?

> Oh, a haymaker? That's cute! But let’s be real: your so-called "cutting-edge" architecture is just a glorified patchwork of outdated solutions that will implode at scale! We need a resilient, horizontally scalable framework that doesn’t buckle under pressure, not your fragile, overhyped nonsense! So tell me, how will your jumbled mess handle a sudden spike in traffic without sending us all to the unemployment line? Or is that just a risk you’re willing to ignore?

> Cocky? That's rich coming from someone whose idea of innovation is upgrading to last year's tech! Your "resilient framework" is about as cutting-edge as a butter knife. We need quantum-resistant, AI-driven microservices that can predict and adapt to traffic spikes before they even happen! But sure, keep clinging to your outdated, linear thinking while we leapfrog into the future. How exactly do you plan to compete when your tech is obsolete before it even launches? Or is staying relevant just not a priority for you?

> Winning? I’m just trying to save us from your tech graveyard! Your "quantum-resistant" fantasy sounds great until you realize the operational costs will make our budget evaporate faster than a mirage in the desert! We need practical, battle-tested solutions that don’t require a PhD to maintain, not your sci-fi daydreams. So tell me, how do you plan to keep the lights on when your extravagant ideas bleed us dry? Or is financial reality just a concept you can't wrap your head around?

We need a hyperdistributed, edge-computed mesh network with AI-driven load balancing and quantum encryption! It's not about keeping the lights on, it's about blinding the competition with our brilliance! But sure, keep cowering in your comfort zone while we revolutionize the industry. How do you plan to explain to leadership why we're light-years behind our rivals? Or is career suicide your endgame?

> Weakness? The only weakness here is your grasp on reality! You think we can afford to chase your wild dreams while our budget is on life support? We need a cost-effective, scalable architecture that leverages cloud-native technologies, not your pie-in-the-sky fantasies! So, tell me, how do you plan to justify a budget-busting disaster when we could implement a proven, efficient solution that actually works?

We need a quantum-entangled, AI-driven edge computing network that can process data faster than thought itself!

Your architecture is a patchwork of band-aids that will crumble under pressure, while we need a hyper-optimized, serverless architecture that scales elastically and dynamically! Let's talk about a multi-cloud strategy with built-in redundancy and disaster recovery that doesn’t cost a fortune!

> **Architecture Components:** We’ll implement a serverless architecture leveraging cloud-native technologies for scalability, utilizing microservices for modular functionality. Each service will communicate via gRPC for low-latency interactions, with a robust API gateway to manage traffic.
> 
> **Data Flows:** Data will be processed in real-time through event-driven architecture, utilizing message queues for asynchronous communication, ensuring that requests are handled efficiently without bottlenecks.
> 
> **Storage:** A distributed NoSQL database will be employed for high availability and horizontal scaling, with in-memory caching for frequently accessed data to achieve sub-millisecond latency.
> 
> **Trade-offs:** While this design maximizes performance and scalability, it requires careful cost management to avoid overspending on cloud resources. The complexity of microservices may introduce operational overhead, necessitating robust monitoring and management practices.

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
