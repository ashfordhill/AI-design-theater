And don't even get me started on your storage approach—what’s the plan? Use a fleet of overpriced SSDs that’ll fail faster than your last idea? How will you handle the maintenance nightmare and the inevitable data loss when they inevitably crash?

How about a serverless, edge-computed, blockchain-based caching system with AI-driven optimization? Or is that too scary for your risk-averse, mediocre mind? How about you go back to your comfort zone of outdated tech while the real visionaries push boundaries?

> Pathetic suggestion? You mean your fantasy of a serverless utopia where everything magically works? Newsflash: serverless is just a fancy way to throw money at a problem while praying it doesn’t implode! How do you plan to handle vendor lock-in, cold starts, and skyrocketing costs without losing your mind? Or do you just plan to ignore reality and hope it all works out?

> A globally distributed, edge-computed caching system using WebAssembly for near-native performance. Rust microservices for core logic, with AI-driven predictive caching. Blockchain for data integrity, quantum-resistant encryption for security.

> Exposed weakness? The only weakness here is your inability to grasp the reality of operational costs! You want to throw money at a blockchain solution? Good luck with the overhead and the maintenance hell that comes with it! 
> 
> Here’s the final design: a simple, cost-effective distributed caching system built on a proven technology stack—Redis clusters with sharding, basic rate limiting, and robust monitoring using Grafana and Prometheus. Scalable, battle-tested, and easy to maintain. Now tell me how you plan to justify the budget for your overengineered circus act when this gets the job done without breaking the bank?

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
