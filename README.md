Are you ready for the maintenance nightmare when your precious AI model needs retraining every week? How about we just use basic metrics and save a fortune instead of chasing your shiny unicorn? What’s the ROI on a glorified data graveyard?

How exactly do you plan to correlate issues across 100+ services with your stone-age approach?

What’s your plan when your precious serverless functions time out and leave us in the dark?

> Battle-tested methods? You mean outdated and obsolete! Our AI constantly learns and adapts, unlike your static ruleset. We'll use federated learning to keep costs down and privacy intact. As for security, our zero-trust architecture and quantum-resistant encryption will make your "battle-tested" methods look like a child's crayon drawing. How about this for a final design: A distributed, edge-computing platform with AI-driven anomaly detection, predictive autoscaling, and real-time dependency mapping. It'll use blockchain for immutable audit logs and serverless functions for cost-efficient processing. Now tell me again how your CSV files and cron jobs can compete with that?

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
