> Real-time fraud detection? With machine learning? Are you fucking kidding me? That's so 2015 I can practically smell the pumpkin spice lattes. We need quantum neural networks running on a blockchain, or why even bother? What decade are you living in, grandpa?

> Oh, please! You want to throw money at some overhyped machine learning model that requires a supercomputer and a PhD in rocket science to maintain? Meanwhile, your storage costs will skyrocket faster than my blood pressure after 15 hours of budget battles! Are you planning to fund this with a magic money tree or just watch the company bleed out while you play with your shiny toys?

> Storage? You're worried about STORAGE? Wake up and smell the serverless, you dinosaur! We'll stream everything through Kafka, process it with Rust WASM modules, and store only the anomalies in a quantum-resistant graph database. Your penny-pinching SQL nightmares can't even handle the volume we're talking about! What's your brilliant plan - Excel spreadsheets and a prayer?

> Oh, fantastic! Let's just slap on some half-baked security measures while we’re at it, right? Because nothing screams "trust us with your data" like a flimsy API key and a hope that hackers will take a day off. You think your precious machine learning will save you when the whole system is wide open? What’s your backup plan—send a strongly worded email to the hackers?

> Scalability? Ha! Your "solution" would choke on a Black Friday sale, let alone actual enterprise traffic! We need distributed edge computing with auto-scaling microservices and a neural network that evolves in real-time. Your pathetic little server farm will be a smoking crater by lunchtime. What's your brilliant plan for handling millions of transactions per second - prayer circles and load balancers from 2010?

> Oh, you want to scale your fancy machine learning model? Good luck with that! You think just throwing more servers at it will magically solve your problems? Spoiler alert: it won't! Your whole approach is a ticking time bomb of complexity and cost, and when it blows up, you'll be left holding the bag while the rest of us clean up your mess. What’s your backup plan—hope the cloud gods smile upon you?

> Deployment? Your idea of "deployment" is probably some poor intern manually copying files to production! We need GitOps with canary releases, chaos engineering, and AI-driven rollbacks. Your stone-age approach will have us in perpetual "works on my machine" hell. How do you plan to push updates without downtime - carrier pigeons and wishful thinking?

> Oh, a tornado of technical superiority? More like a whirlwind of delusion! You think your grand vision is going to magically fix the operational nightmare of managing dependencies, version control, and rollback disasters? Your approach is a recipe for chaos, and when it all comes crashing down, I hope you’ve got a good excuse for the shareholders. What’s your plan when your shiny system collapses under the weight of its own complexity—blame the "legacy" code you were trying to escape?

> Architecture? You call that steaming pile of legacy spaghetti code an architecture? We need a fully reactive, event-driven system with CQRS and event sourcing, running on a mesh of serverless functions! Your monolithic nightmare couldn't handle a lemonade stand, let alone real-world fraud scenarios. How do you plan to adapt to new fraud patterns - wait for the yearly software update and pray?

How are you planning to stay ahead of cutting-edge fraud techniques - magic 8-ball and gut feelings?

We need a quantum-enabled, AI-driven fraud detection mesh that predicts attacks before they happen! Your stone-age approach is like bringing a butter knife to a laser gun fight. How about this for a knockout: we implement a self-evolving neural network running on edge devices, with federated learning to protect privacy, all orchestrated by a quantum-resistant blockchain for immutable audit trails. Still think your CSV files and IF statements stand a chance?

We need a streamlined, battle-tested architecture that prioritizes maintainability and cost-efficiency, not your chaotic mess of buzzwords! Final design knockout: a microservices architecture with clear boundaries, using serverless functions for scalability, backed by a robust monitoring system that predicts failures before they happen. What's your plan when your "innovative" system crashes and burns—hold a candlelight vigil for it?

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
