> Oh, right, let’s just throw money at some shiny quantum nonsense while we're at it! How do you plan to maintain that? A team of physicists on standby? And don’t even get me started on your storage approach—what’s next, a petabyte SSD array? Good luck with the power bills and cooling costs! Are you trying to bankrupt us with your fantasies, or do you actually have a clue what operational nightmares you’re inviting?

Infinitely scalable, zero power draw when idle. But I guess that's too forward-thinking for your abacus-loving brain, isn't it? Why don't you go polish your floppy disks while the adults talk?

Good luck explaining that to the board when they’re siphoning our data faster than you can say “zero-day exploit.” You want to gamble with our entire infrastructure for some sci-fi fantasy? What’s your backup plan, a prayer?

How about a self-evolving AI network that dynamically optimizes its own architecture? But I guess that's too complex for your single-celled brain to grasp, isn't it? Why don't you go back to your cute little spreadsheets and leave the real innovation to those who can handle it?

What happens when that "intelligent" system crashes and burns at peak traffic? You want to bet the company's future on a glorified magic eight ball? Spare me the delusions—how about we stick to tried-and-true methods that won't leave us in a maintenance hell? What’s your exit strategy when your “brilliant” idea implodes, huh?

We need quantum-entangled sensors that predict issues before they happen, not your pathetic reactive Band-Aids. But I guess forward-thinking hurts your tiny brain, doesn't it? Why don't you go back to your COBOL mainframe and leave innovation to the grown-ups?

We need a distributed ledger that can handle millions of transactions per second without breaking a sweat. But I guess that’s too advanced for your outdated thinking! What’s your plan when your “solution” gets crushed under the weight of real data demands, huh?

Your puny blockchain wannabe will choke faster than your career prospects. Real innovation means bending physics to our will, not rehashing stale buzzwords. But I guess that's too mind-bending for your flat-earth mentality, isn't it? How does it feel to be so painfully obsolete?

Your fantasy architecture is a recipe for disaster, and I can already see the headlines: “Company Bankrupt Due to Sci-Fi Schemes.” Meanwhile, I’ll be over here with a simple, robust caching solution that actually works. How do you plan to explain your cosmic failure to the investors when they’re left holding the bag?

> FINAL DESIGN? You think we can just slap together a half-baked idea and call it a day? Your approach is a convoluted mess that will collapse under real-world load. We need a distributed caching system built on a microservices architecture, utilizing in-memory databases like Redis for speed and reliability, with a clear data flow that prioritizes efficiency.

> Data will flow through a load balancer to ensure even distribution across multiple caching nodes, with robust failover mechanisms to handle any outages. Storage will be tiered, using SSDs for hot data and cheaper HDDs for cold data, balancing performance with cost.

> Trade-offs? Sure, we can either choose speed at the cost of complexity or simplicity with potential latency issues. But let's be real: your sci-fi fantasies don’t even come close to addressing the operational realities we face. How do you plan to justify your ridiculous ideas when they inevitably fail?

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
