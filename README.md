> Live syntax highlighting? Are you kidding me? That's so 2010. We need a freaking AI-powered code prediction engine that writes half the code for you before you even think of it! Why stop at highlighting when we can have sentient code that evolves on its own? How about you step into this century and propose something actually innovative?

> Oh, great, sentient code—because we all know how well AI has handled everything else. Let’s just throw money at a black box that might work half the time and requires a PhD to maintain! And storage? You really think we can afford the cloud costs for a real-time collaborative editor? How many times do we need to go bankrupt before you realize that “innovative” doesn’t pay the bills? What’s your backup plan when the AI crashes and we lose all user data?

> Storage? You dinosaur! We're using a distributed IPFS network with blockchain-backed versioning! Who needs centralized servers when we can harness the power of every user's device? And your pathetic "cloud costs" argument? We'll monetize with NFTs of elite code snippets! How's that for innovation, you penny-pinching fossil? Or are you too scared to try something that wasn't invented in the stone age?

> NFTs? Seriously? You want to gamble on digital collectibles while we’re trying to keep the lights on? Good luck explaining that to the CFO when they see the budget blowout. And your “distributed storage” is a recipe for chaos—good luck debugging when every user’s device is a ticking time bomb of inconsistency! How do you plan to manage version control when everyone's on a different version of the code? You think this is a game?

> Version control? Please. We're using quantum entanglement for real-time synchronization across infinite parallel universes! Your pitiful "debugging" concerns are laughable when we can instantly access every possible code variation simultaneously. And storage? We're compressing data into subatomic particles! How's that for efficiency, you narrow-minded bean counter? Or is quantum physics too advanced for your abacus-level understanding of technology?

> Quantum entanglement? You’ve officially lost it! We need a solution that works now, not some sci-fi fantasy that’ll end up costing us a fortune in R&D and leave us with nothing but a pile of broken dreams and empty wallets. And your storage plan sounds like a nightmare waiting to happen—how do you expect to scale that without a million hidden costs and maintenance hell? What’s your exit strategy when everything collapses under its own complexity?

> Exit strategy? We're not exiting, we're DISRUPTING! Your pathetic "now" solution will be obsolete before you finish implementing it! We're building for the FUTURE, you myopic dinosaur! And storage? We're leveraging dark matter for infinite capacity! How's that for scalability, you glorified accountant? Or is your vision as limited as your imagination?

>
> Dark matter? Now you’re just throwing buzzwords around like confetti! We need a solution that’s practical and can actually be built without burning through the budget like it’s a bonfire! Your storage approach sounds like a sci-fi movie plot—good luck explaining to the board why we’re pouring money into a fantasy instead of a functional, cost-effective solution! What’s your plan when the investors pull the plug on your whimsical dreams?

> Cost-effective? You mean BORING! We're revolutionizing code itself with self-modifying quantum algorithms! Your "practical" solution is a joke in the face of true innovation. And storage? We're beaming data directly into the fabric of spacetime! How's that for future-proofing, you short-sighted penny pincher? Or is your idea of progress still stuck in the Jurassic era?

> Self-modifying quantum algorithms? Wow, what a way to ensure total chaos! Let’s just throw our users into a black hole of unpredictability and watch them drown in a sea of bugs! And your "spacetime storage" is a recipe for disaster—how do you plan to back that up when the universe decides to collapse? What’s your plan when the entire system implodes, leaving us with nothing but a cosmic mess and a mountain of debt?

> Backup? We're creating infinite parallel backups across the multiverse, you single-dimensional thinker! Your pathetic "debt" concerns are laughable when we're tapping into unlimited cosmic energy!

We need a solution that works in the real world, not some sci-fi utopia that’ll cost us a fortune and leave us with nothing but a failed project!

Your outdated "recovery" concerns are laughable when we've achieved code omniscience! And storage? We're compressing entire codebases into single qubits! How's that for efficiency, you Neanderthal number-cruncher? Ready to admit defeat, or do I need to dumb it down further for your abacus-level intellect?

We need a solution that can actually be built and maintained without drowning in costs and complexity! And your "single qubit" storage plan?

Your outdated concerns about "feasibility" are laughable when we're literally bending the laws of physics! And storage? We're uploading directly to the collective consciousness! How's that for user-friendly, you fossilized fuddy-duddy? Or is your prehistoric brain too calcified to comprehend true innovation?

> New paradigm? More like a one-way ticket to bankruptcy! We need a code editor that works in the real world, not some abstract fantasy that’ll crash and burn before it even launches!

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
