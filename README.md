> Oh, please! Your "quantum encryption" is just a ticket to budget hell! Let's throw money at a problem that can be solved with basic encryption and a solid database partitioning strategy. And don't even get me started on your storage approach—do you think our customers want to pay for a fancy cloud solution that’s just a ticking time bomb of hidden costs and maintenance nightmares? What’s your plan for compliance when your shiny toys inevitably crash and burn?

> Basic encryption? Database partitioning? What is this, 1995? Wake up, grandpa! Your stone-age solution will crumble under modern threats. And observability? Let me guess, you'll use logging and some off-the-shelf monitoring tool? Laughable. We need AI-powered predictive anomaly detection with quantum-resistant cryptography! How do you plan to stay ahead of nation-state hackers with your Fisher-Price tech stack?

Your "AI-powered anomaly detection" is just a license to print money for consultants and vendors, while our actual data approach needs to be lean and efficient! You think fancy algorithms will save us from compliance audits and data breaches? Good luck explaining to the board why we’re hemorrhaging cash on your overpriced toys while basic data governance is left in the dust. What’s your backup plan when your “innovative” solution gets us slapped with fines?

Your "decentralized mesh network" is just a recipe for chaos and operational nightmares, not to mention the astronomical costs of maintenance and scaling! And for data? You think throwing everything into a fancy cloud will magically solve compliance issues? Newsflash: it’s a dumpster fire waiting to happen!

Your "self-healing microservices" are just a buzzword buffet, and they won't save us from the tidal wave of operational overhead and costs! And your data approach? Please, do you think our clients want to trust their sensitive information to your half-baked, over-engineered mess? How do you plan to explain to them why we’re spending millions on your fantasy while they’re left holding the bag when it all collapses?

With a filing cabinet and an abacus?

## 🛠️ Development

### Adding New Personalities

1. Create personality config in `src/personalities/`
2. Define system prompts and traits
3. Choose appropriate LLM provider
4. Test with validation command

### Adding New LLM Providers

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
