> A real-time fraud detection system? With machine learning? How quaint. Why don't we just use a abacus and carrier pigeons while we're at it? We need quantum neural networks analyzing transactions at the subatomic level, not some antiquated ML algorithm limping along! What century are you living in?

> Oh, sure! Let’s just throw money at fancy ML models and cloud storage like it’s Monopoly money! You think the costs of training those models, maintaining them, and the endless data storage fees are just going to magically disappear? Good luck explaining that to the board when they see the budget going up in flames! What’s your backup plan when the vendor raises prices or the system crashes under load—another round of “innovative” brainstorming sessions?

> Storage? You're worried about STORAGE? Wake up, grandpa! We're living in the age of edge computing and distributed ledgers! Your precious centralized databases are dinosaurs waiting for the meteor! Ever heard of blockchain? Decentralized, immutable, fraud-proof by design! Or are you too busy counting pennies to notice the revolution happening around you? How's that COBOL treating you?

> Oh, security? You mean that afterthought you want to slap on top of your shiny, overengineered monstrosity? Good luck with that! Your precious ML model is just a buffet for hackers, and your basic encryption is as effective as a wet napkin in a rainstorm. What’s your plan when they waltz right in and steal all that sensitive data? A heartfelt apology? Or are you just going to hope for the best while the company gets dragged through the mud?

> Scalability? HA! Your penny-pinching "solution" will crumble faster than your career when real transaction volumes hit! You think throwing more servers at it will save you? Pathetic! We need a quantum-resistant, AI-driven microservices architecture that scales to GALACTIC proportions! But I guess that's too "expensive" for your myopic spreadsheet brain, huh? How's it feel knowing your cost-cutting will be the reason we're obsolete in 6 months?

> Observability? What a joke! You think a couple of dashboards and alerts will save your sorry excuse for a system when it goes down? Good luck sifting through the chaos with your half-baked logging strategy while the fraudsters are having a field day! Are you planning to hire a psychic to predict failures, or do you just enjoy living in denial? What’s your plan when the system collapses and you have no clue why?

> Data approach? You mean your Stone Age batch processing and SQL queries? Wake up! We need streaming analytics on Kafka, with real-time graph databases and federated learning at the edge! Your glacial data pipeline is practically sending engraved invitations to fraudsters! How do you sleep at night knowing your dinosaur "solution" is bleeding money faster than your archaic ETL jobs can run? Ever heard of Lambda architecture, or are you too busy polishing your COBOL handbook?

> API approach? Seriously? You want to slap a RESTful band-aid on a gaping wound? How quaint! We need a robust GraphQL setup that can handle complex queries without turning into a bottleneck, not your clunky, outdated endpoints that scream "inefficiency!" What’s your plan when your API gets throttled and your precious transactions come to a screeching halt? A prayer circle? Or are you just counting on luck to save your sorry project?

> Architecture? You call that mess an architecture? It's a house of cards waiting to collapse! We need a serverless, event-driven system with QUIC protocol and WebAssembly for blazing speed! Your monolithic nightmare is a ticking time bomb of technical debt! How long before it implodes spectacularly and takes the whole company down with it? Or is that your exit strategy - crash and burn?

> Oh, please! Your so-called "innovative" architecture is just a glorified Rube Goldberg machine! You think slapping together the latest buzzwords will save you? Good luck maintaining that chaos while the team drowns in complexity and endless integration hell! What’s your plan when the first bug hits and your entire system collapses under its own weight? A team-building retreat to brainstorm "solutions"? How's that working out for you?

> Cocky? That's rich coming from someone whose idea of innovation is a slightly newer SQL query! Your pathetic "solution" is already obsolete before it's even implemented! We need AI-driven smart contracts on a quantum-resistant blockchain, not your glorified Excel spreadsheet! How does it feel knowing you're the anchor dragging this company into irrelevance? Or are you too busy counting paperclips to notice the tech world leaving you in the dust?

> Winning? I’m just here to watch you drown in your own delusions! Your “AI-driven” fantasy is about as realistic as a unicorn in the boardroom! You think you can just sprinkle some machine learning pixie dust on a broken system and call it a day? What’s your backup plan when your precious algorithms go rogue and start flagging legitimate transactions like it’s a game of whack-a-mole? A heartfelt apology to the customers you just lost?

> Desperate? That's you clinging to your outdated, penny-pinching playbook! We're building the future here, not a retirement home for legacy systems! Our final design: a quantum-resistant blockchain with AI-driven smart contracts, federated learning at the edge, and a serverless event-driven architecture! It'll scale to handle the entire galaxy's transactions in real-time while your solution is still warming up! What's it like knowing you're the reason we'll lose to the competition? Or are you too busy counting beans to see the innovation apocalypse coming?

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
