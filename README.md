> Serverless? Are you f***ing kidding me? That's so 2018. We need a quantum-based image processing pipeline running on a neural network trained by harvesting the collective unconscious of humanity. How else are we supposed to stay competitive in this cutthroat industry? Or are you content with being left in the dust by every two-bit startup with a GitHub account?

> Oh, please! Serverless is a budget-sucking black hole that’ll have us hemorrhaging cash on every invocation! You think we can afford to pay for every single image transformation in a pay-per-use model while processing millions of images? And don’t even get me started on storage—do you really want to dump our data into some overpriced cloud storage that charges us for egress like it’s a luxury hotel? What’s your backup plan when the bills come due and we’re drowning in costs?

> Storage? You dinosaur, we're not "storing" anything! We'll use quantum entanglement to instantly materialize processed images from the multiverse, eliminating storage costs entirely. As for your penny-pinching paranoia, our neural net will optimize itself to be infinitely efficient, scaling costs to zero as it learns. Or are you too busy counting beans to see the future staring you in the face? How does it feel to be the architect of our company's inevitable obsolescence?

> Desperate? I’m just trying to save this sinking ship from your delusions! You think we can afford to throw money at some sci-fi fantasy while the rest of the company burns cash? Your "quantum entanglement" is just a fancy way to say "I have no real plan." And let's not forget the operational nightmare of maintaining that overhyped tech—good luck finding anyone who can even manage it! What’s your backup plan when the reality check hits and we’re left with a pile of overpriced junk?

We'll use a swarm of edge-deployed nanobots to process images in real-time, eliminating storage and latency issues entirely. Or are you too busy cowering behind your spreadsheets to embrace true innovation? How does it feel knowing your risk-averse mediocrity is choking the life out of this company?

We’d need a small army of engineers just to keep that circus running, not to mention the insane costs of deployment and scaling! Are you really willing to bet the company’s future on some pie-in-the-sky fantasy while we’re drowning in operational chaos? How does it feel to be the architect of our downfall?

Newsflash: we need a *realistic* solution that won’t implode under the weight of its own complexity! Your approach is a ticking time bomb of hidden costs and maintenance nightmares, while my plan is grounded in actual engineering principles that can scale without breaking the bank!

Images will be processed instantaneously across all realities, making your antiquated notions of storage obsolete. This cosmic neural network will optimize itself to perfection, rendering your bean-counting irrelevant. How does it feel to be so hopelessly outclassed by true visionary thinking?

Storage becomes irrelevant when we can materialize any image from the quantum foam instantaneously. Your narrow-minded obsession with costs is holding us back from true technological godhood.

> - **Data Flows:** Images are uploaded to a central processing service that distributes tasks to worker nodes, which handle transformations and return results to a storage service.
> - **Storage:** Use a hybrid approach with local caching for immediate access and an affordable cloud solution for long-term storage, minimizing egress costs.
> - **Trade-offs:** Balances cost efficiency with performance, avoiding over-engineering while ensuring maintainability and scalability.
> 
> Now, are you ready to accept that this is the only viable solution, or do you want to keep chasing your fantasy?

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
