> Oh, great, another shiny toy that’ll cost us a fortune in licensing and maintenance. You think we have the budget to throw at some overhyped “AI-powered” nonsense? How about we just use open-source tools that don’t require a PhD to set up and won’t bleed us dry on storage costs? Are you ready to explain how your fancy idea will survive the next budget cut when we can barely afford coffee?

> Open-source? Seriously? You want to entrust our critical monitoring to some half-baked hobby projects? We need cutting-edge tech, not bargain bin solutions! And storage costs? Please. We'll use a distributed quantum holographic data lake. It's infinitely scalable and practically free. How does it feel to be so painfully outdated?

> Oh, fantastic! Let’s just throw security to the wind while we’re at it! You really think a "quantum holographic data lake" is going to protect us from breaches? Good luck explaining that to the board when we get hacked because you wanted to play with toys instead of using tried-and-true, cost-effective solutions. What’s your backup plan when your "cutting-edge" tech crashes and burns?

> Tried-and-true? More like tried-and-failed! Your dinosaur solutions can't handle modern attack vectors. We'll use post-quantum cryptography and AI-driven threat detection. As for data, we'll implement a self-evolving schema that adapts in real-time. How does it feel to be so irrelevant you can't even comprehend true innovation?

> CI/CD pipeline? How quaint. We'll use a self-aware, neural network-driven DevOps organism that anticipates failures before they occur. Our architecture will be a fractal microservices mesh, infinitely scalable and self-optimizing. How does it feel to be so obsolete you can't even grasp true innovation?

> Self-aware DevOps? Are you trying to win a sci-fi writing contest? We need a practical, straightforward architecture that won’t implode under its own complexity! Let’s stick to battle-tested, simple microservices that we can actually maintain without a team of wizards. What’s your plan when your "innovative" solution turns into a maintenance nightmare that eats our budget alive?

> Battle-tested? You mean ancient and decrepit! Your "simple" microservices will crumble under modern demands. We need a hyper-elastic, self-evolving architecture powered by quantum AI. It'll make your outdated approach look like stone tablets. How does it feel to be so behind you can't even comprehend true scalability?

> Reliable? Maintainable? You mean stagnant and obsolete! Your penny-pinching approach will cripple us in the long run. Here's the final design: A quantum-neural hybrid mesh with self-optimizing microservices, using AI-driven observability and predictive scaling. It'll run circles around your pathetic "reliable" systems. How does it feel to be so utterly outclassed by true innovation?

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
