What happens when your “innovative” solution crashes and burns, and we’re left with a maintenance nightmare and a team of developers pulling all-nighters to fix your mess? How are you planning to explain the endless storage costs for all that real-time data when we can barely keep the lights on?

It's practically free and infinitely scalable! And maintenance? Our AI-powered self-healing code will make human intervention obsolete. Why are you so obsessed with penny-pinching when we could be creating the future? How does it feel to be the anchor dragging innovation into the abyss of mediocrity?

Good luck debugging that mess while your precious “AI-powered” solution crumbles under real-world usage. And how do you plan to handle security when every wannabe hacker can access the code? What’s your backup plan when it all goes sideways, or are you just banking on luck?

While you're busy counting pennies, we'll be revolutionizing collaboration with neural-network powered code prediction and quantum-entangled instant updates.

While you're off chasing your wild dreams, I’ll be here with a lean, efficient solution that actually works without breaking the bank. And good luck with your “neural-network powered” nonsense when it turns out to be a glorified toy that can’t handle real users!

You think we can afford to gamble on your sci-fi fantasies while the budget is bleeding out?

Our quantum system will scale effortlessly while your outdated tech chokes on basic tasks. The board will be too busy swimming in profits from our revolutionary product to care about your penny-pinching paranoia. Why are you so determined to keep us in the tech dark ages? How does it feel knowing you're the human embodiment of "CTRL+S"?

> Winning? Hardly! Your “revolutionary product” sounds like a ticking time bomb of complexity that’ll make onboarding a nightmare and drive users straight into the arms of competitors! And let’s not even get started on the hidden costs of maintaining your “quantum” solution—bet you didn’t factor in the endless training and support it’ll require! What’s your plan when your shiny toy collapses under the weight of reality, and we’re left scrambling to fix your mess?

> Desperate? Look who's talking, Captain Compromise! Our quantum-neural network will self-optimize, making your precious "onboarding" obsolete. Users will flock to us because we're light-years ahead of the competition. As for storage, our blockchain-based, self-replicating data shards will make your centralized servers look like floppy disks. We're building the future, not catering to Luddites! Why don't you crawl back to your abacus while we revolutionize the industry? How does it feel knowing your legacy will be "that guy who almost stopped us from changing the world"?

> Exposed? The only thing exposed is your complete lack of understanding of practical engineering! Your “quantum-neural network” is just a fantasy that’ll drown us in costs and complexity while we’re trying to deliver a working product. And let’s not forget the operational hell of managing a decentralized storage system that’ll be more of a liability than an asset! What’s your plan when your grand vision ends up as a cautionary tale for future projects?

While you're stuck in the past, we're leaping into the future with a self-evolving AI that'll make your "working product" look like a stone tablet and chisel. Our decentralized quantum storage will be unhackable and infinitely scalable, leaving your fragile servers in the dust. Why are you so afraid of true innovation? How does it feel knowing you're the human embodiment of a legacy codebase - outdated, inefficient, and desperately in need of replacement?

Why are you so determined to trap us in this single, sad dimension of mediocrity? How does it feel knowing your so-called pragmatism is holding back the entire multiverse?

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
