> A distributed caching system? How quaint. Why don't we just use carrier pigeons while we're at it? Look, if we're not leveraging quantum entanglement for instant data propagation across nodes, why even bother? You really think traditional caching can handle our requirements? Where's your ambition?

> Oh please, "quantum entanglement"? Is that what we’re calling it now? Meanwhile, we can't even afford to keep the lights on with your shiny dreams! Let's talk about the hidden costs of maintaining a distributed system—latency spikes, data consistency nightmares, and the inevitable maintenance hell that’ll have us drowning in operational chaos. You want to handle millions of requests with sub-millisecond latency? Good luck when your fancy storage approach collapses under the weight of its own complexity! What’s your backup plan when your over-engineered mess crashes and burns?

> Storage approach? What storage approach? All I heard was "let's use a rusty filing cabinet and pray". Wake up! We need a hyper-distributed edge cache network powered by AI-optimized data sharding! Anything less is career suicide. You think your penny-pinching can keep up with our latency demands? How's your outdated thinking going to handle inclusive design when you can't even handle basic scalability? Or are accessibility and performance just buzzwords to you?

> Oh, security? You mean the afterthought in your grand vision? Good luck with your "cutting-edge" system when it’s riddled with vulnerabilities because you decided to save a buck on proper encryption and access controls. You think fancy algorithms are going to protect us when your system is leaking data like a sieve? How do you plan to secure millions of requests per second when your budget can't even cover basic security audits? What’s your plan when the hackers come knocking, and your shiny toy crumbles under pressure?

How do you expect to maintain sub-millisecond latency when you can't even see problems coming? Or is your idea of "inclusive design" just making the error messages easier to read? What's your brilliant plan for debugging issues across a million requests per second - prayer?

You think we can manage millions of requests with your half-baked idea of data storage? Good luck with that when we need real-time access and consistency! How do you plan to handle data integrity when your system is a patchwork of cheap hacks? Or is that just another detail you conveniently overlooked in your quest for shiny toys?

Your data approach is a glorified mess of outdated tech that can't even keep up with basic analytics, let alone millions of requests per second.

How's your pathetic "design" going to handle millions of requests when it can't even handle basic load balancing? Or is your idea of scalability just throwing more outdated hardware at the problem?

We need quantum-resistant homomorphic encryption with AI-driven sharding, not your stone tablet and chisel solution!

We need a hyper-converged edge computing mesh with AI-driven data lifecycle management, not your glorified spreadsheet masquerading as a "data approach"! How's your pathetic system going to handle real-time, privacy-preserving analytics across global data centers? Or is "edge computing" just another buzzword you don't understand? What's your brilliant plan for ensuring data locality and compliance across jurisdictions - a world map and some pushpins? Face it, your cost-cutting obsession is holding us back from true innovation. Why don't you go back to counting beans while the adults design a system that can actually meet our requirements?

What’s your plan for scaling when your architecture is a glorified paperweight? Or do you think throwing more money at the same broken system will magically fix it? Face it, your approach is a disaster waiting to happen, and when it implodes, don’t come crying to me. What’s your exit strategy when the whole thing collapses under its own weight?

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
