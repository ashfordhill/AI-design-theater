> Oh, fantastic! Let's just throw money at some overhyped AI that’ll probably crash at 3 AM while we’re all trying to fix a production bug. And storage? You want to store every keystroke in some bloated cloud service? Good luck with the hidden costs of data egress fees and compliance nightmares! How do you plan to explain that to the CFO when the bill comes in?

> Security? Ha! Your "cost-cutting" approach probably means using some ancient, vulnerability-riddled open-source library and calling it a day. We need military-grade, post-quantum cryptography with blockchain-verified access control, you dinosaur! And don't get me started on your pitiful "storage solution." What's next, floppy disks? How can you sleep at night proposing such laughably inadequate security?

> Scalability? You mean your half-baked plan to throw more servers at the problem like it’s some magic fix? Newsflash: that just means more money wasted on infrastructure while your precious editor crashes under real load! How do you plan to handle the operational chaos when your shiny toy can't keep up with 100 users and starts choking? Are you ready to explain that to the board when they see the cash hemorrhage?

How do you plan to justify that dumpster fire to the investors when they see the chaos unfold?

> API approach? Oh, you mean your glorified REST endpoints that’ll be slower than molasses and as secure as a paper bag in a rainstorm? We need microservices with gRPC and zero-trust architecture, not your outdated, clunky mess! How do you expect to handle the traffic when your API is a bottleneck, and your precious users are left waiting? Are you ready to face the wrath of the users when they realize your "solution" is a total joke?

> Architecture? You call that spaghetti mess of microservices an architecture? We need a cutting-edge, event-driven system with CQRS and event sourcing, running on a Rust-based WebAssembly runtime! Your bloated, overengineered disaster is the digital equivalent of a house of cards. How can you even show your face proposing such an amateur-hour setup? Are you trying to sabotage this project?

Are you actively trying to drive this company into the ground with your pathetic, risk-averse mindset?

> Robust and maintainable? You mean BORING and STAGNANT! Wake up, dinosaur! We're building a real-time collaborative editor, not some crusty COBOL mainframe! Here's the knockout design: Rust-based WebAssembly core for blazing performance, serverless edge computing for instant global scalability, and AI-driven conflict resolution. Multi-language support? Quantum language model that adapts in real-time. Security? Post-quantum encryption with blockchain-verified access. It's the future, grandpa - try to keep up! How does it feel to be professionally obsolete?

Language agnostic AST for multi-language support, with AI-powered syntax highlighting. Zero-trust security model with homomorphic encryption for collaborative editing. Blockchain for immutable version control. How's that for practical AND cutting-edge? Still clinging to your Stone Age solutions?

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
