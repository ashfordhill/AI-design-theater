> A secure multi-tenant SaaS platform? With data isolation? What is this, 2010?! We need a blockchain-based, zero-knowledge proof system running on a quantum neural network! Anything less is digital dinosaur thinking. Are you trying to bore our customers to death?

> Oh, please! You want to throw money at a blockchain fantasy? That's a one-way ticket to budget hell with transaction fees and maintenance nightmares. And don't even get me started on your storage approach—do you have any idea how much it costs to scale that? Are you planning to fund this with fairy dust and unicorns?

> Cost-cutting? More like innovation-cutting! Your penny-pinching paranoia is strangling progress! We need distributed edge computing with homomorphic encryption, not your bargain-bin database nonsense. And storage? Decentralized IPFS or nothing! What's next, floppy disks? Are you allergic to anything invented this century?

We need GitOps-driven, AI-optimized, serverless edge deployments with automatic rollbacks! Your stone-age setup will have us manually debugging production at midnight. Are you actively trying to drive our DevOps team to therapy?

A multi-tenant system without a robust failover strategy is just a ticking time bomb. Are you planning to pray to the tech gods when everything goes down?

## 🛠️ Development

### Adding New Personalities

1. Create personality config in `src/personalities/`
2. Define system prompts and traits
3. Choose appropriate LLM provider
4. Test with validation command

### Adding New LLM Providers

2. Add provider to `PersonalityManager`
3. Update configuration and models

### Extending Diagram Generation

1. Add new diagram types to `MermaidGenerator`
2. Implement content analysis patterns
3. Test with various conversation types

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
