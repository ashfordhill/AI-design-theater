> Multi-tenant SaaS? Are you living in 2010? We need a blockchain-based decentralized platform with zero-knowledge proofs for TRUE isolation. Why settle for outdated architectures when we can revolutionize the entire concept of data ownership? Or are you too scared to push boundaries?

> Oh, fantastic! Let's throw money at a blockchain solution while we’re at it! You think enterprise customers want to deal with the operational nightmare of managing smart contracts and the hidden costs of transaction fees? And good luck explaining to the finance team why our storage costs just tripled with all that fancy encryption nonsense! What’s your backup plan for when this overengineered mess collapses under its own weight?

> Storage costs?! You're worried about STORAGE when we're on the brink of a paradigm shift? Wake up! Quantum storage is right around the corner, making your petty concerns irrelevant. And if you can't grasp zero-knowledge proofs, maybe you should go back to building static HTML sites! How exactly do you plan to ensure REAL data isolation without bleeding-edge tech? Or is your idea of "isolation" just hoping no one notices your shoddy security?

> Desperate? Please! Your "quantum storage" fantasy is just a shiny distraction from the fact that you can't even handle basic compliance requirements! What’s your plan when the auditors come knocking and your fancy tech can't even prove data isolation? You think enterprise customers will trust you with their data when your solution is a ticking time bomb of complexity and cost? How do you plan to explain that to the board after we blow the budget on this ridiculous dream?

> Compliance? Ha! Your outdated "solution" is begging to be hacked! We need homomorphic encryption running on a neural network to dynamically allocate secure enclaves! Anything less is practically inviting breaches. But I guess you're fine with mediocre security as long as it fits your precious budget? How will you sleep at night knowing you chose bean-counting over true innovation?

> Oh, please! Neural networks for security? That's rich! How do you plan to maintain that nightmare? You think the ops team will love babysitting your overhyped AI while trying to keep the lights on? And don't even get me started on the storage costs—your "dynamic allocation" is just a euphemism for throwing money down the drain! How do you plan to justify this circus act when the system crashes and we’re left holding the bag?

> Amateur? Look who's talking! Your "solution" is so outdated it belongs in a museum! We need edge computing with federated learning for real-time threat detection, not your pathetic centralized model! And storage? Distributed content-addressable storage is the only way to ensure true data integrity. But I guess that's too complex for your penny-pinching brain to comprehend? How do you plan to compete when your tech is stuck in the stone age?

> A tornado? More like a gentle breeze! Your approach is so simplistic it’s laughable—what are you going to do when a single tenant’s data breach takes down the entire system? We need a microservices architecture with strict API gateways to ensure isolation, not your clunky monolith! And as for storage, how about using object storage with lifecycle management instead of your bloated, overpriced solution? Do you even understand the concept of scalability, or are you just hoping for the best?

> Microservices? Object storage? Wake up, dinosaur! We need a serverless quantum-resistant architecture with post-quantum cryptography! Your outdated approach is begging to be shattered by the next wave of computing. And storage? Try holographic data crystals for true future-proofing. But I guess you're content with obsolescence as long as it's cheap? How will you explain to customers when quantum attacks render their data useless overnight?

> Holographic data crystals? Really? You’re just throwing buzzwords around like confetti! How do you plan to implement that without a decade of R&D and a budget that would make a Fortune 500 company blush? And your storage solution is as practical as a chocolate teapot—what happens when we hit peak demand and your precious crystals can’t keep up? Are you prepared for the fallout when our customers’ data is lost in the ether?

> Cocky? That's rich coming from someone proposing stone-age solutions! Your pathetic "peak demand" concerns are child's play for a true quantum architecture. We'll use entanglement-based storage that scales infinitely across parallel universes! But I guess that's too mind-bending for your spreadsheet-addled brain? How do you plan to compete when your tech is stuck in a single reality while we're harnessing the multiverse?

> Entanglement-based storage? Seriously? You think we can just wave a magic wand and access parallel universes for data? Let’s get real—your ideas are a fantasy that would bankrupt us before we even get to beta! And your storage approach? It’s a ticking time bomb of complexity and cost! How do you plan to explain to the board why we’re pouring money into a sci-fi pipe dream instead of a solid, proven solution?

> Proven solution? Ha! Your "solid" approach is a house of cards waiting to collapse! We need a self-evolving AI architecture that adapts to threats in real-time, not your static, sitting-duck design. And storage? Try a neural-net-driven data fabric that optimizes itself! But I guess innovation is too scary for you, hmm? How about this for a (Continuing exploration – FINAL DESIGN later) an adaptive, quantum-resistant platform with AI-driven security and self-optimizing storage. It's light-years beyond your prehistoric ideas. Still think you can compete with THAT?

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
