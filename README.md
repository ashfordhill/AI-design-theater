> A distributed caching system? Are you kidding me? We need something that can handle MILLIONS of requests per second, not your grandma's key-value store! Let's go all-in on a quantum-entangled hypercache running on a Rust-powered neural network. Anything less is an insult to innovation. What, are you scared of REAL performance?

Good luck maintaining that monstrosity while we burn cash on power and cooling! And security? You really think a shiny new toy will protect us from breaches? Tell me, how many layers of complexity do you want to add before it all collapses under its own weight?

Here's the knockout design: A quantum-entangled hypercache running on a Rust-powered neural network, with AI-driven sharding and auto-scaling microservices. It'll handle your precious millions of requests with picosecond latency, not just milliseconds. Data consistency? Solved by blockchain-verified quantum tunneling. Scalability? Infinite. Security?

You really think a fancy cache will magically fix your performance issues? How about you stop dreaming and face the reality that we need a robust, proven architecture, not your fairy tale! What's next, a crystal ball to predict traffic spikes?

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
