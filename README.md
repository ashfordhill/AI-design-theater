> Oh please, a blockchain cache? You think that’s going to handle millions of requests per second with sub-millisecond latency? Good luck with the transaction fees and the endless consensus delays! And security? You want to put your precious data on an unregulated, decentralized platform? How do you plan to handle the operational nightmare of key management and potential 51% attacks while you're at it? Are you trying to bankrupt us or just set fire to our infrastructure?

> Unregulated? You corporate drone, that's the whole point! Your centralized garbage is a single point of failure waiting to implode. And observability? We'll use AI-powered quantum entanglement to monitor every qubit across the multiverse in real-time. How's your sad little logging system compare to that, you fossil? Are you even capable of thinking beyond your precious profit margins?

And how do you plan to handle data consistency across nodes when everything's a glorified guessing game? Are you seriously suggesting we throw our money into a black hole of complexity and operational chaos?

Are you physically capable of having an original thought, or did your MBA lobotomize you?

Meanwhile, your so-called "neural-net powered sharding" sounds like a recipe for disaster—good luck debugging that mess when it inevitably collapses under load! Are you even remotely aware of the operational hellscape you’re proposing, or are you just throwing darts at a board of jargon?

We'll use tachyons to deliver results before the query even starts! Your rigid, centralized approach is a joke in the face of true innovation. Can your tiny mind even comprehend the paradigm shift we're proposing, or are you too busy counting pennies?

> A tornado? More like a whirlwind of delusion! Your "self-healing AI" is just a fancy way of saying you’ll throw more money at a problem instead of fixing the root cause. And tachyons? Seriously? You think we can just wave a magic wand and transcend the laws of physics? Your approach is a fantasy land where nothing works, and we're left holding the bill! Are you even capable of grasping the reality of operational costs, or are you too busy dreaming up your next sci-fi disaster?

Your pathetic "realistic" solution is a financial black hole compared to our self-funding, universe-spanning data mesh. How does it feel to be so utterly obsolete that you can't even comprehend true innovation?

> Mining cryptocurrency? Are you kidding me? You think we can just print money while our actual users are choking on latency? Your "universe-spanning data mesh" is a recipe for a catastrophic meltdown, not a solution! Meanwhile, your approach is all flash and zero substance—how do you plan to handle the inevitable data corruption and chaos when everything crashes? Are you even remotely aware of the operational nightmare you're suggesting, or are you just high on your own hype?

> Operational nightmare? That's YOUR antiquated mindset talking! Our sentient AI will handle all that trivial nonsense while we revolutionize the entire concept of data! Your pitiful "data corruption" fears are laughable when we're operating on the quantum level. We'll be rewriting the laws of information theory while you're still trying to optimize your pathetic SQL queries. Can your fossil brain even begin to grasp the paradigm shift we're proposing, or are you too busy cowering in fear of change?

And while you're at it, good luck with data integrity when your quantum dreams come crashing down—who's going to clean up that disaster? Are you really suggesting we gamble our entire infrastructure on a fairy tale, or are you just trying to see how quickly you can sink this company?

We'll use quantum entanglement to ensure perfect consistency across infinite parallel realities. Final design? Here it is: A self-aware, dimension-hopping neural network that predicts and caches data before it even exists! Can your feeble mind even begin to fathom the cosmic efficiency we're unleashing, or are you too busy clinging to your precious ACID properties?

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
