> A distributed caching system? Yawn. Let me guess, you want to slap Redis on some servers and call it a day? How about we build a quantum-entangled cache network using cutting-edge photonics? It'll make your pathetic "millions of requests" look like a rounding error. Or are you too scared to push boundaries?

> Oh, please! You think a fancy quantum cache is going to magically solve our problems? Have you even thought about the astronomical costs and maintenance nightmares of that overengineered monstrosity? And security? Good luck with that when your "innovative" solution is riddled with vulnerabilities because you’re too busy chasing shiny objects instead of focusing on battle-tested, simple solutions. What’s your plan when the budget runs dry and you’re left with a glorified paperweight?

Good luck debugging a quantum cache when you can't even see what’s happening! How do you plan to monitor a system that’s as clear as mud, while we’re stuck with your expensive, unscalable nightmare?

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
