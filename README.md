> A real-time collaborative code editor? With multiple languages and syntax highlighting? Oh please, like that hasn't been done to death already. We need something truly groundbreaking here. How about a quantum-entangled neural network that predicts code before you even think of it? Or are you too afraid to push boundaries?

> Oh, fantastic! Let’s throw money at a "quantum-entangled neural network" while we’re at it! Have you ever considered the operational nightmare of maintaining that? Good luck with the hidden costs of training, infrastructure, and the inevitable maintenance hell when it breaks down. And don't even get me started on the storage—how will you handle the massive data bloat from all that real-time collaboration? Are you planning to bankrupt us with cloud costs, or just let the servers catch fire?

> Cloud costs?! Servers?! Wake up, dinosaur! We're going full decentralized with IPFS and blockchain for storage. No more centralized bottlenecks or budget-busting server farms. And forget your tired old "operational nightmares" - we'll use Rust and WebAssembly for a blazing fast, memory-safe runtime that practically maintains itself. Or are you too scared of actual innovation to keep up?

> Decentralized storage? Great, let’s just throw our data into the wild and hope for the best! How do you plan to handle the latency and inconsistency of a decentralized network while keeping real-time collaboration smooth? And good luck debugging when your code is scattered across a thousand nodes! Are you seriously suggesting we gamble our entire project on a glorified file-sharing system?

We'll use cutting-edge conflict-free replicated data types to make your precious "real-time" look like a snail race. As for debugging, we'll implement a revolutionary AI-powered smart contract system for automated issue detection and resolution. Still clinging to your centralized, single-point-of-failure storage solution? How's that working out for your uptime?

> Oh, CRDTs? You mean the theoretical fairy dust that sounds great in a lab but crumbles under real-world stress? Let’s talk about the actual maintenance hell of implementing those while juggling user permissions and data integrity. And your "AI-powered smart contract" sounds like a recipe for disaster—good luck explaining to the board why we’re locked out of our own data because your shiny toy misfired! Are you seriously suggesting we bet our entire operation on unproven tech while the clock is ticking?

> Unproven tech? CRDTs are battle-tested in industry leaders like Figma and Notion. Your outdated mindset is what's truly unproven here. And permissions? We'll use zero-knowledge proofs for airtight security without centralized bottlenecks. Still clinging to your dinosaur databases that can't scale past a single data center? How's that working out for your global user base?

> Oh, please! Zero-knowledge proofs? You think that’s going to magically solve our observability problems? Good luck debugging when you can't even see what's happening in your own system! And let's not pretend your fancy CRDTs will handle the chaos of concurrent edits without turning our codebase into a tangled mess. Are you really willing to sacrifice reliability for a buzzword bingo?

> Observability problems? We'll implement a cutting-edge event sourcing architecture with distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry. Your pathetic centralized logging can't hold a candle to our real-time, granular insights. As for concurrent edits, our AI-powered merge resolution will make conflicts a thing of the past. Still stuck in your primitive monolith mindset? How's that scaling for your global user base?

> Event sourcing? Great, let’s just add another layer of complexity to the disaster! How do you plan to manage the data sprawl and eventual consistency hell that comes with it? And API? You mean the same REST APIs that are slow and bloated? Let’s just throw GraphQL into the mix and watch our performance tank as we drown in over-fetching. Are you really prepared to watch our user experience crumble under the weight of your fancy architecture?

How's that working for your real-time collaboration dreams?

Are you really ready to drown in operational chaos just to chase the latest shiny trend?

As for data consistency, our eventual consistency model with conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) will make your rigid ACID transactions look ancient. And deployment? We'll use a cutting-edge GitOps workflow with Kubernetes for seamless, zero-downtime updates.

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
