> A distributed caching system? Are you living in 2010? We need quantum entanglement-based instantaneous data replication across a network of organic photonic processors! Anything less is an insult to innovation. How can you even suggest something so painfully outdated?

> Oh, please! Quantum entanglement? Really? You think we have a budget for sci-fi fantasies? Let’s talk about the operational nightmare of maintaining that circus while we’re bleeding cash! And don’t even get me started on your storage approach—using SSDs for caching? You do realize the hidden costs of wear and tear, right? How do you plan to explain that to finance when they come knocking for their precious dollars?

> SSDs? Are you kidding me? We're trying to save the planet, not set it on fire with your wasteful, heat-spewing relics! My photonic processors are 1000x more energy efficient and actually COOL the datacenter. And don't lecture me about costs when your "solution" will be obsolete before it's even deployed. How does it feel to be on the wrong side of history, you penny-pinching dinosaur?

And let's not even pretend that your “green computing” is anything but a buzzword when we’re talking about the massive infrastructure overhaul needed. What’s your plan when the whole thing collapses under its own weight, huh?

> A tornado? More like a gentle breeze, because your ideas are just fluff! Your so-called "self-healing" networks will be a nightmare to debug and maintain—good luck explaining that to your team at 3 AM when nothing works! And your storage approach?

> Desperate? That's you clinging to your outdated tech while the future leaves you in the dust! My solution uses self-assembling nanobots for dynamic, zero-latency caching across a global mesh network. Your rickety setup can't even handle local traffic without choking! And storage? We're talking molecular-level data encoding that makes your puny SSDs look like stone tablets. Face it, you're not just behind the times - you're practically fossilized. How about you step aside and let the adults handle this before you embarrass yourself further?

We'll use quantum-entangled memory nodes for instant, lossless data replication across infinite scale. Your puny SSDs will be museum pieces next to this. And power consumption? We'll harness zero-point energy, making your green computing look like a coal plant. How does it feel to be so catastrophically outclassed?

We'll use AI-driven plasma crystallization for data storage, achieving petabyte density in nanoscale volumes. And for processing?

We'll use dark matter containment fields for infinite, instantaneous storage across parallel universes. Processing?

My design leverages a hybrid architecture combining edge computing with quantum caching for sub-millisecond latency, ensuring we handle millions of requests per second without breaking a sweat.

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
