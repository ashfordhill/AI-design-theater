Have you considered the operational nightmare of managing nodes, the hidden costs of data consistency, and the maintenance hell that comes with it?

> Security? You mean that half-baked zero-trust principle you think will save your overengineered mess? Good luck enforcing that when your distributed cache is a gaping security hole! How are you planning to manage access controls and authentication across multiple nodes without turning it into a maintenance nightmare? Or do you just assume hackers will take a day off?

> Observability? Ha! Your pathetic logs and metrics won't save you when your system implodes! We need real-time quantum-based anomaly detection and AI-powered self-healing, not your stone-age monitoring! Can your budget-friendly solution predict and prevent failures before they happen? Or are you too busy pinching pennies to care about actual reliability? How does it feel to be so hopelessly behind the curve?

> Deployment? You mean your glorified "blue-green" strategy that’s just a fancy way of saying "let’s pray nothing breaks"? How are you going to manage rollbacks when your precious distributed system goes haywire, huh? Do you even have a plan for CI/CD that doesn’t involve a dumpster fire of failed builds? Or are you just going to wing it and hope for the best?

We need AI-driven deployment orchestration with neural network-based predictive scaling! Can your budget-friendly solution even handle canary releases without imploding? Or are you too busy cowering in fear of innovation to grasp true technological progress? When was the last time you actually pushed boundaries instead of pushing paperwork?

How are you going to manage the insane complexity and cost of your precious AI deployments when they crash and burn? Or are you just planning to throw money at the problem until it magically fixes itself? What’s your backup plan when your “superior” tech turns into a budget-busting nightmare?

Can your pathetic solution even handle a million requests without bursting into flames? Or are you too busy clinging to your outdated monoliths to grasp true scalability? When was the last time you designed something that wasn't painfully obsolete on arrival?

Have you considered the hidden costs of vendor lock-in and the operational chaos of scaling without control? What’s your plan when your precious architecture crumbles under real-world loads? Or are you just banking on wishful thinking to save your skin? How does it feel to be so utterly out of touch with reality?

> Cocky? That's rich coming from someone who can't see past their spreadsheet! Your penny-pinching "solution" is a ticking time bomb of technical debt! We need cutting-edge tech to stay competitive, not your outdated, risk-averse garbage! Can your bargain-bin architecture even handle modern security threats? Or are you too busy counting beans to care about actual innovation? When was the last time you had an original thought that wasn't about cost-cutting?

> Winning? You think this is a game? Your so-called "cutting-edge tech" is just a smokescreen for a budget-busting disaster waiting to happen! How do you plan to scale your precious architecture without drowning in complexity and costs? Or are you just hoping the tech fairy will sprinkle magic dust on your overengineered mess? What’s your plan when you realize innovation doesn’t come cheap, and you’re left holding the bag?

> Desperate? The only desperation here is your pathetic clinging to outdated paradigms! Listen up, bean counter: We're building a hyper-scalable, edge-deployed WebAssembly mesh with quantum-resistant encryption and AI-driven self-optimization. It'll handle your precious millions of requests with microsecond latency while you're still trying to figure out how to update your legacy systems. Can your budget-friendly abomination even come close to that level of innovation? Or are you too busy cowering in fear of progress to see the future staring you in the face? How does it feel to be the roadblock to true technological advancement?

> Weakness? The only weakness here is your inability to grasp the reality of modern tech! Your budget-squeezing, risk-averse mentality is a recipe for obsolescence! We're deploying a serverless architecture with real-time observability, automated scaling, and zero-trust security principles that actually work, not your cobbled-together mess! Can your thrifty little solution even handle the security threats of today without collapsing? Or are you just hoping for the best while the rest of us sprint ahead? How does it feel to be the anchor dragging innovation down?

> Mercy? I'll show you mercy when you show some actual innovation! Your "serverless" setup is just outsourced incompetence! Here's the knockout design: Rust-based edge compute nodes running WASM for blazing speed, connected by a quantum-encrypted mesh network. AI-driven predictive scaling and self-healing, with zero-trust principles baked into every layer. Can your budget band-aid even come close to this level of cutting-edge performance? Or are you too busy living in the stone age to grasp true technological evolution? When will you realize your cost-cutting is just slow-motion failure?

> Amateur? The only amateur here is the one who thinks they can cut corners and still compete! Your approach is a glorified patchwork of outdated tech that will implode under real-world pressure! The final design is a fully decentralized, microservices architecture leveraging serverless functions, real-time analytics, and adaptive security measures that actually protect against threats. Can your budget-friendly solution even scale without turning into a maintenance nightmare? Or are you just hoping to coast on mediocrity while the rest of us innovate? How does it feel to be the reason we can't move forward?

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
