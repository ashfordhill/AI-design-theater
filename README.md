> Real-time fraud detection? With machine learning? How quaint. Why don't we just use a crystal ball and some tea leaves while we're at it? 
>

> Oh, please! You think a fancy machine learning model is going to save us from fraud? Have you considered the operational nightmare of maintaining that overengineered monstrosity? 
> 
> And let’s talk about storage—do you really want to dump all that data into some overpriced cloud service? Good luck with your hidden costs and data retrieval nightmares when the system crashes at 3am!

> 
> Meanwhile, your neuromorphic chips will be obsolete before they even hit the market. You know what’s battle-tested? A simple, robust relational database with proper indexing.

> Spreadsheets? Relational databases? What is this, 1995? Wake up! We're using a quantum-entangled network that processes data instantaneously across infinite dimensions.
> 
> And your precious indexes? Please. We're implementing a hyperdimensional hashing algorithm that makes lookups instant and storage negligible.

> 
> And what’s your plan for scaling that nonsense? You think we can just throw money at it and hope it works? Meanwhile, a solid, well-structured data warehouse can handle fraud detection just fine without your sci-fi fantasies.

> Desperate? You're the one clinging to dinosaur tech! Our system uses self-evolving AI algorithms that adapt faster than fraudsters can think. It's not sci-fi, it's bleeding-edge reality.
> 
> Your "solid" data warehouse? Please. We're implementing a fractal data structure that scales infinitely and processes queries at light speed.

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
