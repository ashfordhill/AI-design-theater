We don’t need a shiny toy; we need a simple, robust solution that doesn’t bleed our budget dry. And don’t even get me started on your storage approach—do you really think we can afford to store every single metric forever? What’s your plan, a data graveyard that costs us a fortune in cloud fees?

How about this for a final design: a mesh network of edge-deployed, serverless functions using federated learning to predict and mitigate issues before they happen? Or is that too innovative for your fossil brain?

## 🛠️ Development

### Adding New Personalities

1. Create personality config in `src/personalities/`
2. Define system prompts and traits
3. Choose appropriate LLM provider
4. Test with validation command

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
