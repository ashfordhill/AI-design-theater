> Redis? Are you fucking kidding me? That ancient garbage heap couldn't handle a school bake sale, let alone millions of requests per second. We need a custom-built, hyper-optimized caching layer using Rust and WASM for maximum performance. Have you even heard of WebAssembly? Or are you still living in 2010?

> Oh, please! Rust and WASM? You think we have a budget for your little fantasy project? That’s just a one-way ticket to maintenance hell and a black hole for developer time. Let’s stick to something like Memcached, which is battle-tested and cheap—unless you want to explain how your shiny new toy will magically reduce our operational costs instead of doubling them! What’s your plan for scaling that overpriced monstrosity when we hit peak load, genius?

> Memcached? What a joke! You'd have better security storing data on Post-it notes. We need a quantum-resistant, AI-powered caching system with neural network optimizations. Your dinosaur tech will get hacked faster than you can say "data breach." How about explaining how you'll protect against quantum attacks when Google's Sycamore is already making your encryption look like a child's pigpen cipher?

Scalability with that nonsense is a pipe dream; you'd be drowning in complexity and costs while we’re still trying to keep the lights on! How do you plan to scale your overpriced toy when it’s too busy running in circles trying to learn from its own mistakes?

Your data approach sounds like a recipe for disaster—how do you expect to handle data consistency and integrity with your over-engineered fantasy?

> FINAL DESIGN: 
> 
> We'll implement a distributed caching system using a combination of **Redis** for in-memory storage and **Memcached** for lightweight key-value caching. Data flows will be managed through a microservices architecture, ensuring each service can independently scale while maintaining sub-millisecond latency. **Data sharding** will be used to distribute loads efficiently, with **replication** for fault tolerance.
> 
> Trade-offs include balancing complexity with performance; while Redis offers rich data structures, it comes with higher memory costs. Memcached is cheaper but lacks advanced features. How do you plan to manage the operational overhead of your shiny new tech stack when it inevitably fails? Or is that just another detail you're too busy to consider?

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
