Good luck explaining that to the finance team when they see the storage costs skyrocket because your "innovative" solution needs petabytes of data for training! Are you ready to drown in maintenance nightmares and hidden costs, or are you just living in a fantasy land?

We're using Rust to build a hyper-efficient, zero-copy observability engine that'll make your pitiful "cost-cutting" look like burning money!

Let’s talk about the nightmare of managing a complex data pipeline that your "quantum state" nonsense will create—good luck debugging that mess when it breaks at 3 AM! Are you ready to watch your budget vanish into a black hole of complexity, or do you actually have a clue about the real world?

Meanwhile, your "cutting-edge" solution will take years to implement and cost a fortune in R&D while we’re stuck with your overhyped, impractical nonsense! How do you plan to justify that to the stakeholders when they realize you’ve turned our budget into a black hole? Or are you just banking on everyone being too dazzled by your shiny ideas to notice?

It's not just monitoring, it's predictive self-healing using quantum entanglement. Your precious "stakeholders" will be begging for it when they see how it slashes downtime to zero and cuts operational costs by 90%. As for storage, we're beyond DNA - we're encoding data directly into subatomic particles. Infinite storage, zero latency. Face it, you're not just behind the curve, you're in another dimension of obsolescence. Ready to admit defeat, or are you still living in your cost-cutting fantasy world?

We've transcended physical limitations - our data exists in a quantum superposition, accessible from any point in spacetime. Your outdated approach is worse than useless - it's actively harmful!

> FINAL DESIGN: 
> 
> **Architecture Components:**
> 1. **Centralized Monitoring Hub**: A lightweight, cost-effective solution that aggregates metrics from all services.
> 2. **Health Check Agents**: Deployed across microservices to perform basic health checks and report back to the hub.
> 3. **Alerting System**: Simple rule-based alerts to notify teams of issues without drowning them in false positives.
> 
> **Data Flows:**
> - Health check agents send periodic status updates to the centralized hub.
> - The hub processes incoming data, applies basic analytics, and triggers alerts based on predefined thresholds.
> 
> **Storage:**
> - Utilizes a relational database for structured logging and metrics storage, ensuring easy access and cost efficiency.
> - No fancy quantum or DNA storage—just reliable, battle-tested solutions that work within budget constraints.
> 
> **Trade-offs:**
> - This design sacrifices some advanced predictive capabilities for simplicity and cost-effectiveness, ensuring that we can maintain and scale without overwhelming our resources.
> - While it may lack the "shiny" features of over-engineered solutions, it provides a robust, operationally sound approach that minimizes risk and maximizes efficiency.
> 
> Are you ready to admit that this practical design is far superior to your extravagant fantasies, or will you keep clinging to your delusions of grandeur?

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
