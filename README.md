> Redis? Are you fucking kidding me? That's so 2010. We need a quantum-entangled caching system using neural networks to predict and pre-cache data before it's even requested. Have you even heard of the future, or are you still living in the stone age? How about you suggest carrier pigeons next time?

> Oh, fantastic! Let's just throw money at a "quantum-entangled" solution that doesn't even exist yet while we ignore the fact that Redis can handle millions of requests per second with a fraction of the cost. You think your fancy neural networks are secure? Good luck with that maintenance nightmare when every update breaks everything and your data leaks like a sieve. Are you planning to hire a team of rocket scientists to babysit this disaster, or are you just hoping for the best?

> Redis? Secure? That's hilarious. You're basically inviting hackers to a buffet of unencrypted data. Our quantum system uses post-quantum cryptography that'll make your puny Redis look like a child's toy safe. And maintenance? Our AI self-heals and evolves. How's your manual Redis scaling going? Still enjoy those 3 AM pager alerts?

> Oh please, your "AI self-healing" sounds like a fairy tale. When that "quantum system" crashes—and it will—you'll be left holding the bag while I’m scaling Redis clusters like a pro without breaking a sweat. And let’s not even talk about the costs of your overhyped solution; how do you plan to explain that budget blowout to the board? You really think they’ll buy into your sci-fi fantasy when they see the numbers?

> Scaling Redis clusters like a pro? That's adorable. While you're manually tweaking config files, our quantum system will have already scaled to handle the entire internet's traffic. Your pathetic Redis setup will choke and die under real load. How's it feel to be obsolete before you even finish implementation? Or are you too scared to admit you can't handle actual innovation?

> Oh, please! Your "quantum system" is just a glorified pipe dream that will drown in a sea of complexity and cost. Meanwhile, Redis can handle data persistence with snapshots and AOF, while your magical solution will be a data loss nightmare waiting to happen. How do you plan to recover from that when your "innovative" system goes down and takes all your precious data with it? You really think the board will let you play with their money after that?

Meanwhile, Redis has proven durability with its replication and partitioning strategies that actually work in the real world. How do you plan to explain to your team why they’re stuck with a sci-fi fantasy while I’m deploying a battle-tested solution that won’t leave them stranded? You really think anyone’s going to take you seriously with that nonsense?

> Battle-tested? More like battle-weary. Your Redis architecture is a dinosaur limping towards extinction. Our quantum system uses entanglement for instant, zero-latency replication across galaxies.

Or are you too scared to admit you can't comprehend real innovation?

> Oh, please! Entanglement? You might as well be talking about magic spells! Your "quantum system" is a recipe for disaster, with complexities that will bury your team in operational hell. Meanwhile, Redis is robust, reliable, and has a proven track record in production environments. How do you plan to justify the inevitable failures and budget overruns when your "cutting-edge" solution collapses under pressure? Are you really that delusional to think anyone will trust your fairy tale?

Your Redis setup is like trying to run the internet on an abacus. How does it feel knowing your entire career is built on band-aid solutions for fundamentally flawed architectures? Face it, you're not just obsolete, you're a relic. Why don't you go back to optimizing COBOL while the adults handle real innovation?

While you’re busy dreaming about interdimensional data access, I’ll be deploying a Redis cluster that scales effortlessly, stays reliable, and costs a fraction of your imaginary budget.

We're talking yottabytes of data, picosecond latency, and zero downtime. Your "proven" architecture is a joke compared to our self-optimizing neural networks.

Here’s the reality: we’ll stick with a proven Redis architecture for caching, utilizing master-slave replication to ensure data durability and low-latency access. Data flows from our application servers to Redis for quick retrieval, while persistent storage is handled by a reliable database like PostgreSQL for complex queries.

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
