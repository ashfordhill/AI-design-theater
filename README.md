> Oh great, a "quantum-entangled observability mesh." What a fancy way to say "let's throw money at a problem instead of solving it." You really think we can afford to store all that data from 100+ services in some overpriced cloud solution? Good luck with the hidden costs of data egress and the maintenance nightmare that comes with it. How do you plan to explain that budget blowout to the CFO when the system crashes and burns?

> - Elasticsearch for logs, optimized for search performance with sharding.
> 
> **Trade-offs:**
> - **Cost vs. Complexity**: This design is cost-effective but requires manual setup and maintenance.

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
