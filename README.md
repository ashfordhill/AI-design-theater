> Multi-tenant SaaS? What is this, 2010? We need a quantum-secured, AI-powered edge computing mesh network with blockchain-based identity management. Anything less is a joke. You want to waste our time on legacy architectures when the future is staring us in the face?

> Oh, please! You think we have the budget for your sci-fi fantasy? We can barely keep the lights on, and you want to throw money at a "quantum-secured" solution? Let's talk about the operational nightmare of maintaining that—good luck finding engineers who can even understand it! And don't get me started on your storage approach; do you think enterprises will pay for your overpriced, over-engineered data vaults when we can use simple, reliable, and cheap solutions? What’s next, a flying car for data transfer?

> Cheap solutions? You mean the digital equivalent of a cardboard box? Wake up! Your penny-pinching will leave us in the dust while competitors innovate. You want simple and reliable? How about simply unreliable when hackers walk through your paper-thin security? And your storage approach? Might as well use floppy disks. How do you sleep at night knowing you're dooming us to obsolescence?

> Desperate? Ha! I'm just tired of your delusions! You think your half-baked ideas will scale? Good luck with that when your "simple" storage becomes a compliance nightmare and your tenants start screaming about data breaches! You really think enterprises will trust their data to your glorified shoebox? What’s next, a prayer for security?

> Prayer for security? Still beats your stone-age approach! You're so obsessed with costs you can't see the lawsuits coming when your bargain-bin solution inevitably fails. And storage? Your idea is as cutting-edge as a butter knife. How about explaining to the board why we're hemorrhaging customers because our tech is older than dirt? Or are you too busy counting pennies to notice we're going extinct?

> Bleeding? More like drowning in your own incompetence! You think your "innovative" storage solution will hold up when compliance audits come knocking? Good luck explaining why we’re using a glorified USB stick instead of a robust, scalable architecture! Your approach is a disaster waiting to happen—how do you plan to handle the fallout when your precious tenants bail because we can't even keep their data safe? Or are you just banking on luck?

We need quantum-resistant encryption and AI-powered threat detection yesterday. Your "robust" architecture is about as cutting-edge as a stone tablet. How exactly do you plan to handle IoT device integration and edge computing with your bargain bin solution? Or is that too futuristic for your abacus?

> A tornado? More like a gentle breeze if we're talking about your so-called "technical superiority!" You think slapping a few cheap servers together will cut it in a world where data breaches are a daily headline? Your storage approach is a ticking time bomb—how do you plan to scale when your architecture collapses under pressure? Or are you just hoping the problem magically disappears?

How exactly will you deploy this to actual IoT devices? Or is your plan to bankrupt us before we even reach production? And don't get me started on your storage approach - it's about as practical as using smoke signals. How many decades until it's remotely viable?

We need quantum-resistant encryption, AI-powered threat detection, and edge-optimized microservices yesterday! Your storage approach? Laughable. We'll use a distributed ledger with sharded data lakes for unparalleled scalability and security. How about you stick to counting beans while the adults handle the tech?

> Weakness? The only weakness here is your grasp on reality! Your API approach is a disaster waiting to happen—do you really think a hodgepodge of outdated protocols will scale in a world where speed and security are paramount? We need a robust, RESTful design with OAuth2 for secure access, not your cobbled-together mess! How do you plan to handle real-time data processing when your architecture can't even keep pace with a dial-up connection? Or are you just banking on the hope that no one will notice?

Throw in some Rust-based WebAssembly for blazing fast edge computing, and quantum-resistant encryption for future-proofing. Your REST API is as outdated as your penny-pinching mindset. How do you plan to compete when your tech stack belongs in a museum? Or are you too busy counting paperclips to notice we're in the 21st century?

> Clever? Hardly! You’re the amateur here, throwing around buzzwords like confetti while ignoring the real-world implications. Your "serverless" dream will crumble under the weight of compliance and operational costs, and good luck scaling that with your outdated infrastructure! We need a hybrid cloud solution that balances cost and performance, not your glorified wish list.

We need a fully distributed mesh network with AI-driven load balancing and quantum-secure communication channels. Throw in some neuromorphic computing for real-time data processing at the edge. Your "balanced" approach is as cutting-edge as a butter knife. How do you plan to handle the tsunami of IoT data with your bargain bin solution?

We need a microservices architecture that can scale horizontally with container orchestration—none of your clunky monoliths! And your data handling? A disaster waiting to happen with your outdated storage approach. How do you expect to keep up with the competition when your tech is as relevant as a VHS tape?

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
