> Serverless? Are you fucking kidding me? That's so 2018. We need a quantum-based image processing pipeline running on a neural network backbone. Why settle for millions when we could do BILLIONS of transformations per nanosecond? Or are you too scared to push real boundaries?

> Oh, please! Serverless is a budget-sucking black hole! You think we can afford to pay for every single invocation while processing millions of images? And don’t even get me started on storage—what’s your plan? Storing all those images in some overpriced cloud storage? Good luck with that maintenance nightmare when costs skyrocket and performance tanks! Are you seriously suggesting we throw money into a bottomless pit just for some shiny tech?

> Storage? Ha! Your prehistoric file systems are a joke. We'll use a distributed quantum holographic memory array, obviously. It'll store petabytes in a subatomic particle. As for costs, our AI-driven neural net will optimize itself, getting exponentially more efficient by the millisecond. Your "budget" concerns are laughably short-sighted. Or are you too technologically illiterate to grasp true innovation?

Good luck with that when hackers feast on your overpriced toys like it's Thanksgiving! Meanwhile, our basic, battle-tested solution will have layers of security that don't cost an arm and a leg. Are you ready to face the reality that your "innovative" ideas are just a recipe for disaster?

> FINAL DESIGN: 
> 
> **Architecture Components:** We'll implement a microservices architecture using lightweight containers to handle image processing tasks, ensuring scalability without the overhead of serverless solutions. Each service will be independently deployable, allowing for rapid iteration and maintenance.
> 
> **Data Flows:** Images will be ingested via a robust API gateway, processed through dedicated microservices for transformations, and routed to a centralized logging and monitoring service to ensure observability and performance tracking.
> 
> **Storage:** We'll utilize a cost-effective object storage solution for raw and processed images, ensuring durability and easy access without the astronomical costs of cloud storage. 
> 
> **Trade-offs:** While this design prioritizes cost and reliability, it sacrifices some level of complexity in processing speed compared to over-engineered solutions. However, the trade-off is worth it for a sustainable and maintainable system that can handle real-world demands without collapsing under its own weight.

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
