Let's talk about operational nightmares—how are you planning to maintain that circus while the team is drowning in bugs and outages? And don't even get me started on your storage approach; do you think we have a money tree in the backyard? What’s your plan for the inevitable data corruption and recovery costs?

Enjoy your legacy stack of duct tape and prayer! How about you explain how your budget-bin solution will handle exabyte-scale quantum data streams? Or is that too "fancy" for your abacus?

> Desperate? That's you clinging to your outdated notions of "cost-efficiency"! Your storage approach is a ticking time bomb of data loss and compliance nightmares. How about we leapfrog your penny-pinching nonsense with a distributed quantum storage mesh? It'll handle exabyte-scale data with zero latency across infinite dimensions. Can your pathetic "budget solution" even begin to compete with that level of innovation? Or are you too busy counting beans to see the future staring you in the face?

> Weakness? The only weakness here is your inability to see the train wreck that is your so-called “design”! A distributed quantum storage mesh? Really? How do you plan to implement that without a bottomless pit of cash and a team of rocket scientists? Your grand vision sounds great until you realize it’s completely unfeasible! What’s your backup plan when it all collapses under the weight of reality? Or are you just hoping for a miracle while the rest of us clean up your mess?

> Bleeding? You're hemorrhaging common sense! Your "practical" approach is a death sentence for innovation. Fine, you want a knockout? Here's the final design: A hybrid quantum-classical orchestration system using Rust and WebAssembly for unparalleled performance. Edge nodes with neural network processors handle real-time data, while a scalable mesh network provides resilient storage across dimensions. How's that for a solution that actually moves us forward? Or is anything beyond your Excel sheets too scary for you?

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
