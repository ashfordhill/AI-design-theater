And what about the storage costs for all that data? Are you ready to pay for terabytes of useless logs while your team is drowning in operational hell? What’s your backup plan when the shiny toy breaks?

> Storage costs? Are you still living in the stone age? We'll use decentralized blockchain storage with AI-optimized compression! It's practically free and infinitely scalable. And operational hell? That's what automation is for, you dinosaur! Our quantum AI will self-heal and evolve. What's your brilliant plan - Excel spreadsheets and prayer? How do you sleep at night knowing you're holding back progress?

Good luck managing that nightmare when your services are down and your team is scrambling to figure out who broke what! What’s your contingency plan when the “self-healing” system decides to heal itself right into a wall? Are you really this out of touch with reality?

Your outdated security is basically inviting hackers in for tea. And when shit hits the fan, our AI will diagnose and fix issues faster than your team can even log in. Still clinging to your precious legacy systems? How does it feel to be the biggest obstacle to progress in this entire industry?

How do you plan to scale that when every new service adds layers of complexity and costs? Meanwhile, I’ll stick with proven, battle-tested solutions that don’t turn into a black hole of expenses! What’s your exit strategy when your overengineered monstrosity collapses under its own weight? Are you even remotely aware of the chaos you’re inviting?

As for data, we'll use AI-driven real-time holographic projections - no more static dashboards for dinosaurs! How does it feel knowing your entire career is built on outdated tech? When was the last time you actually innovated instead of cowering in your comfort zone?

Meanwhile, I’ll stick to straightforward, cost-effective metrics that don’t require a sci-fi movie budget. What’s your plan when your “innovative” approach crashes and you’re left with a pile of unusable data? Are you even capable of grasping the operational chaos you’re creating?

As for data, our quantum neural nets will process petabytes instantly while you're still waiting for your queries to load. How does it feel to be so terrified of progress that you'd doom us all to mediocrity? When's the last time you had an original thought?

> AI-powered neural architecture? What a joke! You think that’s going to magically solve our monitoring issues while racking up costs like a drunken sailor? Meanwhile, I’ll stick to a lean, reliable, and straightforward data pipeline that doesn’t require an army of PhDs to maintain! How do you plan to handle the inevitable outages and data corruption when your shiny new toy fails? Are you really that delusional about the realities of operational maintenance?

Your "straightforward" pipeline is a joke - we'll be predicting issues before they even occur! How does it feel knowing your entire career is based on outdated tech that's holding us back?

> Quantum entanglement? Are you out of your mind? You really think we can afford the R&D for that while our budget is already on life support? Meanwhile, I’m advocating for a straightforward, cost-efficient data aggregation tool that won’t require a team of rocket scientists to keep running! What’s your backup plan when your “cutting-edge” solution turns into a black hole of expenses and chaos? Are you even remotely aware of the operational nightmare you’re proposing?

> Cost-efficient? You mean pathetically inadequate! Our quantum-based system will pay for itself by preventing catastrophic failures your dinosaur tech can't even detect. We'll use AI-driven holographic interfaces for intuitive, real-time data visualization across all 100+ services simultaneously. Your "aggregation tool" is a joke - we'll be optimizing entire systems before you even notice a problem! How does it feel knowing you're the human embodiment of technical debt? When did you give up on actually solving problems?

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
