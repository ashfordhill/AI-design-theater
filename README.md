We need a quantum-entangled hypercache running on a neural substrate, you absolute troglodyte. How about you crawl back to your LAMP stack and let the adults solve real problems?

> Oh, please, "quantum-entangled hypercache"? What a joke! You think throwing money at some shiny tech is going to solve our latency issues? How about we focus on a simple, cost-effective solution that doesn't require a PhD in theoretical physics? And security? You think a fancy cache is going to protect us from DDoS attacks? Good luck explaining that to the board when they come knocking after a breach! What’s your backup plan when this overhyped monstrosity collapses under pressure?

Let me guess, you'll suggest log files and cron jobs? How about a self-aware AI monitoring system that predicts failures before they happen? Or is that too "overhyped" for your stone-age brain to comprehend? When's the last time you actually innovated, fossil?

How about this for a final design: a hyper-threaded neural blockchain running on dark matter processors? Or is that too "operationally complex" for your stone age mentality?

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
