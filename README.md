> Oh please, a decentralized P2P network? You mean a glorious recipe for a maintenance nightmare and endless debugging hell? Good luck explaining to the board why our servers are crashing every time someone types "hello world." And let’s talk about storage—do you think we have a bottomless budget for some fancy cloud solution? Or are you just planning to throw money at AWS until we’re bankrupt? What’s your backup plan when the whole thing collapses under load?

> Storage? Ha! Your prehistoric centralized databases are laughable. We'll use a distributed IPFS-based system with smart contracts for version control. It's bulletproof, scalable, and makes your AWS nonsense look like a floppy disk. And load issues? Please. Our AI-powered load balancing will make your servers look like abacuses. Got any actual innovative ideas, or just more penny-pinching excuses?

> Oh, please! Your "distributed IPFS" is just a fancy way to say "let's make everything slow and unreliable." Scalability? You think throwing AI at a problem magically makes it better? Good luck when your "brilliant" solution crashes under real user load and we’re left scrambling to fix it at 3 AM. How do you plan to handle the inevitable chaos when your precious system can't keep up? Or is that just part of your "innovative" charm?

> Slow and unreliable? That's rich coming from someone clinging to centralized dinosaur tech! Your pathetic "solution" will buckle under its own weight before we even launch. At least our system can scale infinitely - unlike your budget-bin servers. What's your brilliant plan for handling global traffic spikes? Prayer? Or just praying your résumé is up to date when this inevitably implodes?

> Observability? You mean your vague "let's throw some logs at it and hope for the best" strategy? Good luck trying to debug a mess of distributed components when everything's failing in real-time! Our approach will use battle-tested monitoring tools that actually give us actionable insights instead of just pretty graphs. How do you plan to track down issues in your convoluted setup when it all goes dark? Or are you just hoping for a miracle?

> Battle-tested tools? More like battle-worn relics! We're implementing cutting-edge observability with AI-powered anomaly detection and predictive analytics. Your "actionable insights" are yesterday's news. As for data, we're using a quantum-resistant blockchain for unbreakable security and integrity. How's your outdated SQL holding up against modern threats? Or are you still living in the stone age of data management?

> Quantum-resistant blockchain? Seriously? You think we have the budget for that shiny toy? Meanwhile, your precious data is just sitting in a glorified spreadsheet waiting to be hacked. We need a solid, cost-effective relational database that can handle transactions without turning into a disaster. What’s your backup plan when your "quantum" solution is still a decade away from being practical? Or are you just banking on future tech to save your bacon?

> Cost-effective? You mean cheap and fragile! Our architecture uses serverless microservices with event-driven design, scaling instantly and effortlessly. Your monolithic nightmare will crumble under its own weight. And relational databases? Please. We're using a distributed graph database for lightning-fast queries and flexible schema. How's your rigid table structure going to handle complex code relationships? Or is SQL all your outdated brain can process?

>
> Oh, wow, serverless microservices—how original! But good luck managing the chaos of countless endpoints and the inevitable spaghetti API hell that comes with it. Your "lightning-fast queries" will turn into a slow crawl when your API calls start hitting rate limits and timeouts. What’s your plan for handling all those inter-service communications when they start failing left and right? Or are you just hoping the cloud gods will keep everything running smoothly?

>
> Rate limits? Timeouts? Amateur hour! We're using GraphQL with schema stitching for a unified API layer that laughs at your pathetic REST endpoints. As for deployment, we're leveraging GitOps with Kubernetes operators for zero-downtime, self-healing infrastructure. Your idea of "deployment" is probably still FTPing files to a shared host, right? How do you sleep at night knowing your entire system could implode from a single config error?

>
> GitOps and Kubernetes? You mean a complex web of over-engineered nonsense that requires a PhD just to manage? Good luck explaining that to the team when they can’t even remember which namespace to deploy to! Your "self-healing" infrastructure will be a nightmare of cascading failures, and I can’t wait to see you try to debug that mess at 3 AM. What’s your plan when the whole thing goes down and you’re left holding the bag? Or are you just going to blame it on the "cloud"?

> Oh please, like your bare-metal solution is any better? Wake up! We're building a cutting-edge system here, not a museum exhibit. Our setup will run circles around your outdated junk. Here's the knockout design: Rust-based microservices, WebAssembly for client-side performance, GraphQL API with AI-assisted query optimization, and a distributed graph database. All running on a serverless architecture with ML-powered auto-scaling. It's bleeding-edge, scalable, and makes your proposal look like it was written in crayon. Still think you can compete, or are you ready to admit defeat?

> Oh, please! Rust-based microservices? You mean a recipe for developer headaches and endless compilation times? Your "bleeding-edge" tech stack is just a shiny way to invite chaos and confusion into our lives. Meanwhile, I’ll stick to proven solutions that deliver results without the drama. How do you plan to onboard developers when they’re drowning in complexity? Or are you just banking on a miracle to make everything work?

Final knockout: Rust backend, WASM frontend, GraphQL API, distributed graph DB, serverless deployment, ML-powered scaling. It's innovative, secure, and performant. Your "safe" approach is a ticking time bomb of technical debt. How will you explain to leadership when we're light-years ahead in features and performance? Or are you just hoping to retire before your house of cards collapses?

> Light-years ahead? Is that your excuse for throwing money at every shiny tech fad? Your "innovative" stack will be a maintenance nightmare, and good luck finding developers who want to deal with that complexity! Final design knockout: a simple, robust, cost-effective architecture using a well-structured monolith with microservices where absolutely necessary, leveraging a traditional SQL database for reliability and performance. How do you plan to justify the endless costs of your over-engineered disaster when the simplest solution works best? Or are you just banking on the buzzwords to distract from your lack of actual results?

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
