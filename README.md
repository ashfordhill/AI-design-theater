## 🛠️ Development

### Adding New Personalities

1. Create personality config in `src/personalities/`
2. Define system prompts and traits
3. Choose appropriate LLM provider
4. Test with validation command

### Adding New LLM Providers

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
