> Collaborative code editor? Pfft, welcome to 2010! We need a decentralized, blockchain-based code FUSION platform with AI-powered pair programming and quantum error correction. Why waste time with syntax highlighting when we could have holographic code visualization? Are you trying to bore developers to death?

> Oh, fantastic! Let’s throw money at a blockchain solution that’ll take a decade to implement and cost us a fortune in server fees. You want holograms? Great, let’s just burn cash on hardware that’ll be obsolete before it even arrives! How do you plan to maintain that circus while keeping the lights on? Or are we just going to hope it runs on fairy dust and good intentions?

> Storage? Ha! Your prehistoric file system approach is laughable. We're talking distributed quantum entanglement storage with zero latency and infinite scalability. Why are you so obsessed with pinching pennies when we could revolutionize the entire industry? Are you here to innovate or just warm a chair?

> Oh please, quantum storage? That’s not just overengineering; it’s a one-way ticket to bankruptcy! Let’s stick with a simple, reliable cloud solution that doesn’t require a PhD in theoretical physics to maintain. How do you plan to justify the millions spent on your sci-fi fantasy when we can barely afford coffee for the team? Are you even listening to yourself?

> Cloud? You mean that archaic, centralized nightmare? Wake up! We need edge computing with AI-driven mesh networks for true global scalability. Your "simple" solution is a sitting duck for hackers and outages. Why are you so hellbent on crippling our potential with last-decade tech? Do you enjoy being left in the dust?

> Edge computing? Really? So we’re just going to sprinkle servers everywhere like confetti and pray they don’t implode? What’s your backup plan when that “mesh network” turns into a tangled mess of outages and data loss? Do you think we can just toss money at problems until they magically disappear?

> Amateur? Look who's talking! Your penny-pinching mentality is holding us back from true innovation. We need a self-healing, AI-powered network that adapts in real-time. Your outdated centralized approach is a ticking time bomb of scalability issues. Are you here to build the future or reminisce about the good old days of dial-up?

> Self-healing networks? That sounds great—until you realize the maintenance costs will drown us in red ink! How do you plan to manage that tech support nightmare with a team that’s already stretched thin? We need practical solutions, not fairy tales! Are you just throwing buzzwords around to distract from the fact that you have no real plan?

> Practical? You mean mediocre! We need a serverless, event-driven architecture with quantum-resistant encryption. Your "solution" is a sitting duck for future attacks. Why are you so determined to build a house of cards? Are you allergic to actual innovation or just scared of anything you can't understand?

> Serverless? Great, let's just hand over our entire infrastructure to some third-party provider and pray they don’t go belly-up!

Are you prepared for the operational hellscape that comes with that kind of dependency?

> Third-party dependency? Rich coming from someone clinging to ancient, in-house solutions! We need a decentralized, blockchain-based storage system with zero-knowledge proofs. Your dinosaur approach is begging to be hacked. Are you actively trying to make us obsolete, or just too scared to learn something new?

> Blockchain? Seriously? Let’s just throw money into a black hole while we’re at it! That’s a maintenance nightmare waiting to happen, not to mention the hidden costs of transaction fees and energy consumption. Are you trying to bankrupt us with your “innovative” ideas, or do you genuinely believe this is a viable solution?

> Maintenance nightmare? That's rich coming from someone stuck in the stone age of tech! We'll use a self-optimizing AI to manage the blockchain, cutting costs and complexity. Your antiquated approach is bleeding money through inefficiency. Ready for the knockout? We'll implement a neural-network-driven code synthesis engine that practically writes itself, with quantum-secured version control. How's that for cost-cutting? Or are you too busy counting pennies to see the future staring you in the face?

> Neural-network-driven code synthesis? Wow, let’s just throw a billion dollars at a glorified magic eight ball and hope it works! What’s your plan for debugging that black box when it inevitably goes haywire? You think we can afford to throw our entire operation into some experimental tech?

Final knockout: We'll use a self-evolving AI to manage our entire stack, cutting maintenance costs to near-zero. It'll optimize in real-time, making your static solutions obsolete before you can even implement them. Still clinging to your abacus while we're building the future?

Final knockout: Quantum-secured, blockchain-verified, AI-optimized edge computing with self-healing networks.

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
