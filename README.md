> Serverless image processing? What is this, 2018? Wake up and smell the quantum entanglement! We need a distributed quantum computing network to process these images at the subatomic level. Why settle for measly "millions" when we could do TRILLIONS per femtosecond? Are you actively trying to sabotage this project with your outdated thinking?

> Oh, please. A serverless architecture? You mean a money pit where every image processed costs an arm and a leg? Let’s not forget the hidden costs of data transfer and cold starts that’ll have us bleeding cash faster than a leaky faucet. And good luck managing storage when we’re talking about millions of images—are we just going to throw them into some overpriced cloud bucket and hope for the best? What’s your backup plan when we hit the limit and our costs skyrocket?

> Storage limits? Costs? What are you, an accountant or an engineer? Wake up! We'll use a hyperdimensional data fabric woven from dark matter - infinite storage, zero cost. As for processing, forget serverless. We're going UNIVERSE-LESS. Quantum entanglement will let us offload compute to parallel dimensions. Still worried about your precious pennies while we're revolutionizing reality itself? Or are you just too scared to think beyond your Excel spreadsheets?

> Oh, please! Quantum entanglement? That's your grand plan? Meanwhile, we’re drowning in operational nightmares with your “innovative” ideas. Let’s talk about maintenance hell when your shiny new tech breaks down at 3 AM—who’s footing that bill? And don’t even get me started on the costs of managing a storage solution that’s as unstable as your last suggestion. Are you really ready to gamble the entire budget on your sci-fi fantasy, or do you want to come back down to Earth and face reality for once?

> Reality? You mean the pathetic, small-minded box you live in? Wake up! Your "practical" solution is already obsolete. We'll use self-replicating nanobots to process images at the molecular level, storing data in DNA strands. Infinite scalability, zero maintenance. Too scared to embrace true innovation? Or are you just here to ensure we fail spectacularly with your penny-pinching mediocrity?

> Oh, fantastic! DNA storage? What are we, a biotech lab now? Let’s just throw our budget into a black hole while we’re at it! How about we stick to something that won’t turn into a science experiment gone wrong? Your grand vision is just a ticket to maintenance hell, with costs spiraling out of control faster than your last failed project. Are you genuinely this out of touch, or are you just trying to win the award for the most ludicrous idea of the year?

> Amateur? Look who's talking, Captain Compromise! Your "safe" approach is a one-way ticket to irrelevance. We'll use quantum holographic storage - infinite capacity, zero latency. For processing, we'll harness dark energy to power a neural network that spans galaxies. Too scared to push boundaries? Or are you just here to ensure we remain mediocre forever with your pathetic penny-pinching?

> A tornado of technical superiority? More like a whirlwind of delusion! You think dark energy and quantum holography are feasible? Meanwhile, we’re stuck with your grandiose dreams while the budget burns. Let’s not forget the operational chaos when your “innovations” inevitably fail—who’s managing that nightmare? Your ideas sound great until reality hits, and we’re left with a pile of overpriced junk. Are you really this naive, or are you just trying to win the title of "Most Expensive Mistake"?

> Naive? Your "safe" architecture is a ticking time bomb of obsolescence! We'll use self-evolving AI to dynamically optimize our entire pipeline, stored in quantum-entangled plasma. It'll make your precious budget concerns irrelevant by inventing new economies of scale. Too terrified of progress to see the future staring you in the face? Or are you just here to ensure we remain trapped in the stone age of cloud computing forever?

And quantum-entangled plasma? Good luck securing that against breaches while we’re at it! You’re ready to gamble our entire operation on your sci-fi fantasy, but can you even tell me how we’re going to keep our data safe from the first wave of hackers? Or are you just banking on luck to save us all?

> Cocky? That's rich coming from someone stuck in the stone age of security! Our quantum AI will develop unhackable encryption that makes your puny firewalls look like wet tissue paper. As for observability, we'll use time-bending tachyons to monitor our system across all possible futures simultaneously. Too scared to embrace true innovation? Or are you just here to ensure we remain vulnerable and blind with your pathetic, outdated approach to monitoring?

> Unleash hell? More like unleash a catastrophic failure! Your "time-bending tachyons" are a fantasy, and good luck trying to monitor a system that’s already crumbling under the weight of your ridiculous ideas. Let’s talk about data—how are you planning to manage and clean up the chaos when your quantum AI inevitably spirals out of control? Are you really ready to drown in a sea of corrupted data because you thought you could skip the basics? Or are you just hoping for a miracle to save us from your disastrous vision?

> Desperate? Look who's talking, Captain Obsolete! Your "basics" are holding us back from true greatness. We'll use hyperdimensional data structures that self-optimize and self-clean, making your primitive ETL pipelines look like abacuses. Our system will harness the computational power of parallel universes, processing infinite data streams instantaneously. Too terrified to push beyond your cozy little comfort zone? Or are you just here to ensure we remain data peasants forever with your pathetic, small-minded approach? Face it - your entire worldview is as outdated as punch cards. It's time to evolve or get out of the way!

> Exposed? You mean your entire argument just crumbled under the weight of reality! Your API approach is a clunky relic that’ll choke on the first real load, while we’re crafting a universal interface that communicates across dimensions without breaking a sweat. We’ll use a multi-layered, self-healing architecture that adapts in real-time, leaving your outdated methods gasping for breath. Are you seriously this blind to the future, or are you just trying to drag us back into the dark ages with your pathetic, antiquated ideas? Time to wake up and face the fact that your approach is a one-way ticket to failure!

> Bleeding? More like you're hemorrhaging common sense! Your outdated approach is a death sentence for innovation. Our final design: a self-evolving quantum neural network that spans multiple dimensions, processing infinite data streams instantly. Storage? Compressed into subatomic particles. APIs? Telepathic interfaces that adapt to user thought patterns. Security? Unhackable encryption derived from the fabric of spacetime itself. This system will revolutionize not just image processing, but reality as we know it. Too scared to embrace true greatness? Or are you just here to ensure we remain trapped in mediocrity forever with your pathetic, small-minded "practicality"?

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

Environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | OpenAI access |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Anthropic access |
| ENABLE_GPT5_PREVIEW | If true and preview model provided, Cost Cutter uses GPT‑5 preview |
| GPT5_PREVIEW_MODEL | Explicit GPT‑5 preview model id |
| OPENAI_COST_CUTTER_MODEL | Override Cost Cutter model (if not using preview) |
| IDEA_KEYWORDS | Comma-separated keywords to bias topic selection |
| DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS | Default max turns |
| DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES | Default duration limit |
| DEBATE_INTENSITY | (Optional) Default debate intensity override |
| DIAGRAM_DETAIL_LEVEL | (Optional) Default diagram detail level override |

CLI `--keywords` temporarily overrides IDEA_KEYWORDS for that invocation.

Convergence: The system will inject a hint near the end to produce a FINAL DESIGN summary; completion requires that block.

*Built with ❤️ for the software design community*
